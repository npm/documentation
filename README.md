# npm Documentation

This is the documentation for
[https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

## Running locally

First, `npm install` the dependencies.  This will install gatsby, et al.

Next, `npm run develop` to test changes.  This will start gatsby on port
8000.  You can navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the site
live.

Any changes that you make will be reflected immediately.

## CLI

The documentation for the [npm cli](https://github.com/npm/cli) is not
modified in this repository.  Instead, the canonical location for it
is in the [npm/cli](https://github.com/npm/cli) repository.  Modifications
to those files are automatically included here for completeness.

Pull requests to CLI documentation in this repository will be closed.

## Theme

The gatsby theme used here is a variation of
[doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat), with some theme changes
for npm's design language and additional components to support multiple
versions of the CLI documentation.
