Form 1099-G (Rev. 1-2022) (keep for your records) www.irs.gov/Form1099G
Instructions for Recipient
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this 
form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or EIN). 
However, the issuer has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the payer has 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Caution: Identity Theft (IDT). If you suspect that you are a victim of IDT, do not
report the incorrect amount shown in box 1 of Form(s) 1099-G on your tax 
return. Go to www.irs.gov/idtheftunemployment for more information.
Box 1. Shows the total unemployment compensation (UC) paid to you in the 
calendar year reported. Combine the box 1 amounts from all Forms 1099-G and 
report the total as income on the UC line of your tax return. Except as explained 
below, this is your taxable amount. If you made contributions to a governmental
UC program or to a governmental paid family leave program and received a 
payment from that program, the payer must issue a separate Form 1099-G to 
report this amount to you. If you itemize deductions, you may deduct your 
contributions on Schedule A (Form 1040) as taxes paid. If you do not itemize, 
only include in income the amount that is in excess of your contributions.
Box 2. Shows refunds, credits, or offsets of state or local income tax you
received. It may be taxable to you if you deducted the state or local income tax 
paid on Schedule A (Form 1040). Even if you did not receive the amount shown, 
for example, because (a) it was credited to your state or local estimated tax, (b) 
it was offset against federal or state debts, (c) it was offset against other offsets, 
or (d) you made a charitable contribution from your refund, it is still taxable if it 
was deducted. If you received interest on this amount, you may receive Form 
1099-INT for the interest. However, the payer may include interest of less than 
$600 in the blank box next to box 9 on Form 1099-G. Regardless of whether the 
interest is reported to you, report it as interest income on your tax return. See 
your tax return instructions. 
Box 3. Identifies the tax year for which the box 2 refunds, credits, or offsets
shown were made. 
Box 4. Shows backup withholding or withholding you requested on
unemployment compensation, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans, or
certain crop disaster payments. Generally, a payer must backup withhold on
certain payments if you did not give your TIN to the payer. See Form W-9 for 
information on backup withholding. Include this amount on your income tax 
return as tax withheld.
Box 5. Shows reemployment trade adjustment assistance (RTAA) payments you 
received. Include on the “Other income” line of Schedule 1 (Form 1040).
Box 6. Shows taxable grants you received from a federal, state, or local
government.
Box 7. Shows your taxable Department of Agriculture payments. If the payer
shown is anyone other than the Department of Agriculture, it means the payer
has received a payment, as a nominee, that is taxable to you. This may
represent the entire agricultural subsidy payment received on your behalf by the 
nominee, or it may be your pro rata share of the original payment. See Pub. 225 
and the Schedule F (Form 1040) instructions for information about where to 
report this income. Partnerships, see Form 8825 for how to report.
Box 8. If this box is checked, the amount in box 2 is attributable to an income
tax that applies exclusively to income from a trade or business and is not a tax
of general application. If taxable, report the amount in box 2 on Schedule C or F 
(Form 1040), as appropriate.
Box 9. Shows market gain on CCC loans whether repaid using cash or CCC
certificates. See the Schedule F (Form 1040) instructions.
Boxes 10a–11. State income tax withheld reporting boxes.
