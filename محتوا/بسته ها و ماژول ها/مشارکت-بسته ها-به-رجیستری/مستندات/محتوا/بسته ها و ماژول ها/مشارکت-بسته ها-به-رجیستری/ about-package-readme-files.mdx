title: About package README files
---

To help others find your packages on npm and have a good experience using your code in their projects, we recommend including a README file in your package directory. Your README file may include directions for installing, configuring, and using the code in your package, as well as any other information a user may find helpful. The README file will be shown on the package page.

An npm package README file must be in the root-level directory of the package.

## Creating and adding a README.md file to a package

1. In a text editor, in your package root directory, create a file called `README.md`.
2. In the `README.md` file, add useful information about your package.
3. Save the `README.md` file.

<Note>

**Note:** The file extension `.md` indicates a Markdown file. For more information about Markdown, see the GitHub Guide "<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#what">Mastering Markdown</a>".

</Note>

## Updating an existing package README file

The README file will only be updated on the package page when you publish a new version of your package. To update your README file:

1. In a text editor, update the contents of the `README.md` file.

2. Save the `README.md` file.

3. On the command line, in the package root directory, run the following commands:

   ```
   npm version patch
   npm publish
   ```
