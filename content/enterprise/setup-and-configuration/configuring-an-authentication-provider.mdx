title: Configuring an authentication provider

import shared from '../../../src/shared.js'

<Note>
<><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid being locked out of your instance, you must connect your npm Enterprise admin account to your SSO account immediately after configuring an authentication provider. If you are locked out of your instance, {shared['contact-enterprise-support'].text}.</>
</Note>

As an Enterprise admin, you can configure your instance to use single sign-on (SSO) authentication through any external authentication provider that implements [OpenID Connect Core][oid-connect-core] and [OpenID Connect Discovery][oid-connect-discovery], such as [Auth0][auth0], [Azure Active Directory][azure], [Okta][okta], and [Google][google].

1. Log in to your Enterprise instance using your temporary username and password.

2. <>{shared['enterprise-admin-panel'].text}</>

   <>{shared['enterprise-admin-panel'].image}</>

3. Click "settings".

   <>{shared['enterprise-admin-panel-settings'].image}</>

4. On the Settings page, click "Configure Single Sign-On".

   * Client ID
   * Client Secret

7. On your SSO provider application website, enter your npm Enterprise instance callback URL: `www.<company-name>.npme.io/sso/callback`.

8. To connect your npm Enterprise admin account to your SSO account, visit `https://<company-name>.npme.io/login/via/1`.

## Removing users from your authentication provider

When you remove a user from your authentication provider, we also recommend [deactivating][deactivate-users] them in your instance.
