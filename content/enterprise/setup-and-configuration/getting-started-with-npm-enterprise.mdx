title: Getting started with npm Enterprise
---

As an npm Enterprise admin, once you have created a temporary username and password from the signup link for your new instance, you should:

1. Log in to your npm Enterprise instance.
2. [Configure SSO authentication][auth-config]
3. Link your account to your SSO provider.
4. [Create one or more organizations][create-orgs].
5. Tell users to log in to the instance with their SSO credentials.
6. [Add users to organizations and teams][add-org-users].
7. Have users follow the steps in the "[Getting started][getting-started]" and "[Packages and modules][pkg-module]" documentation to [download Node.js and npm][download-npm], [configure their npm client][config-client], and [publish][publish-pkg] and [install][install-pkg] packages.
