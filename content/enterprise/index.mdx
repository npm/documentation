In March 2020, npm was acquired by GitHub. On June 30, 2020, we notified npm Enterprise (npmE) customers of our intent to sunset npm Enterprise. **npm Enterprise will be supported until June 30, 2021**, and we will renew contracts for npmE until that date. We encourage all npmE customers to evaluate and migrate to GitHub Packages.

Customers who already have one of GitHub’s Free, Teams, or Enterprise Cloud plans already receive monthly storage and bandwidth resources for GitHub Packages as part of their plan. To begin evaluating GitHub Packages, visit our documentation on [publishing with GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/publishing-a-package) directly from your repository.
