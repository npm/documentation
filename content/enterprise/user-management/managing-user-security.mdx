title: Managing user security
---

To keep your npm Enterprise instance secure, as an Enterprise instance admin, you should:

* Limit the number of additional Enterprise admins on your instance.
* [Deactivate users][deactivate-users] who no longer need access to your npm Enterprise instance (such as users who have left the company) as quickly as possible.

Users of your npm Enterprise instance should:

* [Enable 2FA][2FA] on their Enterprise instance accounts.
* Use [read-only tokens][read-only-tokens] to delegate access to private packages to other tools in their workflow.
