title: Promoting a non-admin user to admin
---
import shared from '../../../src/shared.js'

<Note>

**Note:** To keep your Enterprise instance secure, we recommend limiting the number of Enterprise admins on your instance.

</Note>

If you need multiple users in your Enterprise instance to be able to take admin actions (e.g. configure SSO, activate and deactivate users, or invite users to the instance), you can promote a non-admin user to admin.

1. If you haven't already, add the user to your instance, either by having them sign in with your SSO provider, or by inviting them to create a username and password on the instance.
2. <>Have an Enterprise admin {shared['contact-enterprise-support'].text} with the name of the user to be promoted to admin.</>
