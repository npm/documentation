import shared from '../../../src/shared.js'

<>As an npm Enterprise admin, you can {shared['contact-enterprise-support'].text} to completely remove a user from your Enterprise instance if they will never need to access the instance again.</>

<Note>

**Note:** When permanently deleting a user, you will work with npm support to make sure any organizations and packages they own are transferred to other users on your Enterprise instance.
