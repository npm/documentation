In March 2020, npm was acquired by GitHub. On June 30, 2020, we notified npm Enterprise (npmE) customers of our intent to sunset npm Enterprise. **npm Enterprise will be supported until June 30, 2021**, and we will renew contracts for npmE until that date. We encourage all npmE customers to evaluate and migrate to GitHub Packages.

Customers who already have one of GitHubâ€™s Free, Teams, or Enterprise Cloud plans already receive monthly storage and bandwidth resources for GitHub Packages as part of their plan. To begin evaluating GitHub Packages, visit our documentation on [publishing with GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/publishing-a-package) directly from your repository.
