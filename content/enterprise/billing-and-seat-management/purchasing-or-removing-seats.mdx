title: Purchasing or removing seats
---

As an npm Enterprise billing manager, you can purchase additional seats for your instance, or remove seats you no longer need. If you remove seats, the credit card on file will not be charged for them starting with the next billing cycle.

To purchase or remove seats for your instance, contact your npm account manager or our [Sales team][sales-contact-form].
