Node.js modules are a type of [package][about-pkgs] that can be published to npm.

## Overview

1. [Create a `package.json` file](#create-a-package-json-file)
2. [Create the file that will be loaded when your module is required by another application](#create-the-file-that-will-be-loaded-when-your-module-is-required-by-another-application)
3. [Test your module](#test-your-module)

## Create a `package.json` file

1. To create a `package.json` file, on the command line, in the root directory of your Node.js module, run `npm init`:
   - For [scoped modules][scoped-pkg], run `npm init --scope=@scope-name`
   - For [unscoped modules][unscoped-pkg], run `npm init`
2. Provide responses for the required fields (`name` and `version`), as well as the `main` field:
   - `name`: The name of your module.
   - `version`: The initial module version. We recommend following [semantic versioning guidelines][semver] and starting with `1.0.0`.

For more information on `package.json` files, see "[Creating a package.json file][creating-pkg-json]".

## Create the file that will be loaded when your module is required by another application


In the file, add a function as a property of the `exports` object. This will make the function available to other code:

```
exports.printMsg = function() {
  console.log("This is a message from the demo package");
}
```

## Test your module

1. Publish your package to npm:

   - For [private packages][priv-pkg-pub] and [unscoped packages][unscoped-pkg-pub], use `npm publish`.
   - For [scoped public packages][scoped-pkg-pub], use `npm publish --access public`

2. On the command line, create a new test directory outside of your project directory.

   ```
   mkdir test-directory
   ```

3. Switch to the new directory:

   ```
   cd /path/to/test-directory
   ```

4. In the test directory, install your module:

   ```
   npm install <your-module-name>
   ```

5. In the test directory, create a `test.js` file which requires your module and calls your module as a method.

6. On the command line, run `node test.js`. The message sent to the console.log should appear.
