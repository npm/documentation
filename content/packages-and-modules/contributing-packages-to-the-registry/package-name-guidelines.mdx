title: Package name guidelines
---

When choosing a name for your package, choose a name that

- is unique
- is descriptive
- meets [npm policy guidelines][policies]. For example, do not give your package an offensive name, and do not use someone else's trademarked name or violate the [npm trademark policy][npm-trademark].

Additionally, when choosing a name for an [**unscoped** package][create-unscoped], also choose a name that

- is not already owned by someone else
- is not spelled in a similar way to another package name
- will not confuse others about authorship
