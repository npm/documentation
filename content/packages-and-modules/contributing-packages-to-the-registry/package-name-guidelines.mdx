title: Package name guidelines
---

When choosing a name for your package, choose a name that:

- Is unique
- Is descriptive
- Meets [npm policy guidelines][policies]. For example, do not give your package an offensive name, and do not use someone else's trademarked name or violate the [npm trademark policy][npm-trademark].
- Does _not_ contain uppercase letters

Additionally, when choosing a name for an [**unscoped** package][create-unscoped], choose a name that:

- Is not spelled in a similar way to another package name
- Will not confuse others about authorship
