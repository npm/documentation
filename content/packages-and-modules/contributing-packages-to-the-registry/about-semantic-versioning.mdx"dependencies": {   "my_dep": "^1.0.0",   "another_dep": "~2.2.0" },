To keep the JavaScript ecosystem healthy, reliable, and secure, every time you make significant updates to an npm package you own, we recommend publishing a new version of the package with an updated version number in the [`package.json` file][pkg-json] that follows the [semantic versioning spec][semver-org]. Following the semantic versioning spec helps other developers who depend on your code understand the extent of changes in a given version, and adjust their own code if necessary.

<div class="note">

<span class="bold">Note:</span> If you introduce a change that breaks a package dependency, we strongly recommend incrementing the version <span class="bold">major number</span>; see below for details.

</div>

## Incrementing semantic versions in published packages

To help developers who rely on your code, we recommend starting your package version at `1.0.0` and incrementing as follows:

| Code status | Stage | Rule | Example version |
|-------------|-------|------|----------------|
| First release | New product | Start with 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 |
| Backward compatible bug fixes | Patch release | Increment the third digit | 1.0.1 |
| Backward compatible new features | Minor release | Increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero | 1.1.0 |
| Changes that break backward compatibility | Major release | Increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero | 2.0.0 |

## Using semantic versioning to specify update types your package can accept

You can specify which update types your package can accept from dependencies in your package's `package.json` file.

For example, to specify acceptable version ranges up to 1.0.4, use the following syntax:

* Patch releases: `1.0` or `1.0.x` or `~1.0.4`
* Minor releases: `1` or `1.x` or `^1.0.4`
* Major releases: `*` or `x`

For more information on semantic versioning syntax, see the [npm semver calculator][semver-calc].

### Example

```json

"dependencies": {
  "my_dep": "^1.0.0",
  "another_dep": "~2.2.0"
},
```
