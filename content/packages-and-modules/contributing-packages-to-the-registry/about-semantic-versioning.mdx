To keep JavaScript packages healthy and reliable, it's important to update them properly. Every time you make big changes to a package you own, it's a good idea to publish a new version of it. This new version should have a different version number in the [`package.json` file][pkg-json]. This helps other developers who use your package know what's changed and decide if they need to update their own code.

**Note:** If you make a change that breaks how another package works, it's best to increase the version number a lot. We call this a **major number** change. It helps users understand that something big has changed.

## How to Number Your Versions

Here's a simple guide to help you decide what version number to use:

| Situation             | Stage          | Rule                                                 | Example Version |
| ----------------------| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| First Release         | New Product    | Start with `1.0.0`                                   | 1.0.0           |
| Fixes for Bugs        | Patch Release  | Increase the last number                              | 1.0.1           |
| Adds New Features     | Minor Release  | Increase the middle number and set the last to zero   | 1.1.0           |
| Changes that Break Things | Major Release  | Increase the first number and set the middle and last to zero | 2.0.0           |

## Saying What Versions You Can Use

You can tell your package what kind of updates it's okay to use from other packages. You do this in the `package.json` file. Here are some examples:

- Small fixes: `1.0` or `1.0.x` or `~1.0.4`
- Adding features: `1` or `1.x` or `^1.0.4`
- Big changes: `*` or `x`
