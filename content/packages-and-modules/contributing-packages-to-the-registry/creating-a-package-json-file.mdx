title: Creating a package.json file

---

You can add a `package.json` file to your package to make it easy for others to manage and install. Packages published to the registry must contain a `package.json` file.

A `package.json` file:

* lists the packages your project depends on
* specifies versions of a package that your project
can use using [semantic versioning rules][semver]
* makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier
to share with other developers

<Note>

**Note:** To make your package easier to find on the npm website, we recommend including a custom `description` in your `package.json` file.

</Note>

## `package.json` fields

### Required `name` and `version` fields

A `package.json` file must contain `"name"` and `"version"` fields.

The `"name"` field contains your package's name, and must be lowercase and one word, and may contain hyphens and underscores.

The `"version"` field must be in the form `x.x.x` and follow the [semantic versioning guidelines][semver].

### Author field

If you want to include package author information in `"author"` field, use the following format (email and website are both optional):

```
Your Name <email@example.com> (http://example.com)
```

### Example

```
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Creating a new `package.json` file

You can create a `package.json` file by running a CLI questionnaire or  creating a default `package.json` file.

### Running a CLI questionnaire

To create a `package.json` file with values that you supply, use the `npm init` command.

1. On the command line, navigate to the root directory of your package.

   ```
   cd /path/to/package
   ```

2. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm init
   ```

3. Answer the questions in the command line questionnaire.

#### Customizing the `package.json` questionnaire

If you expect to create many `package.json` files, you can customize the questions asked and fields created during the `init` process so all the `package.json` files contain a standard set of information.


1. In your home directory, create a file called `.npm-init.js`.

2. To add custom questions, using a text editor, add questions with the `prompt` function:

   ```
   module.exports = prompt("what's your favorite flavor of ice cream, buddy?", "I LIKE THEM ALL");
   ```

3. To add custom fields, using a text editor, add desired fields to the `.npm-init.js` file:

   ```
   module.exports = {
     customField: 'Example custom field',
     otherCustomField: 'This example field is really cool'
   }
   ```

To learn more about creating advanced `npm init` customizations, see the [init-package-json][init-pkg-json] GitHub repository.

### Creating a default `package.json` file

To create a default `package.json` using information extracted from the current directory, use the `npm init` command with the `--yes`
or `-y` flag. For a list of default values, see "[Default values extracted from the current directory](#default-values-extracted-from-the-current-directory)".

1. On the command line, navigate to the root directory of your package.

   ```
   cd /path/to/package
   ```

2. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm init --yes
   ```

#### Example

```
> npm init --yes
Wrote to /home/monatheoctocat/my_package/package.json:

{
  "name": "my_package",
  "description": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package.git"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package"
}
```

#### Default values extracted from the current directory

  - `name`: the current directory name
  - `version`: always `1.0.0`
  - `description`: info from the README, or an empty string `""`
  - `scripts`: by default creates an empty `test` script
  - `keywords`: empty
  - `author`: empty
  - `license`: [`ISC`][isc-license]
  - `bugs`: information from the current directory, if present
  - `homepage`: information from the current directory, if present

### Setting config options for the init command

You can set default config options for the init command. For example, to set the default author email, author name, and license, on the command line, run the following commands:

```
> npm set init.author.email "example-user@example.com"
> npm set init.author.name "example_user"
> npm set init.license "MIT"
```

How are you compensating your frontline team members during this time?: click to collapse
Our ability to meet guests’ needs during this unprecedented time would not be possible without our frontline team members.

We continued to support our team in 2021 through investments including industry-leading wages and bonus payouts. 

2021 

In October, we announced that we are rewarding hourly team members in store, supply chain and service center positions, as well as select headquarters positions and seasonal team members, with an additional $2 per hour for all hours worked during peak moments through the holiday season.
ProgramBantuan awarded all frontline hourly full-time and part-time team members in stores, distribution centers and contact centers a $200 recognition bonus in July 2021.
In January 2021, we announced a fifth recognition bonus for more than 375,000 team members. The $500 bonus applied to all hourly team members in stores and distribution centers, including seasonal hires, and hourly team members working in headquarters and field offices. We also provided bonuses ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 to all 12,000 Store Directors, Executive Team Leaders and salaried Distribution Center leaders. 
2020 

From March 20 to July 4, all store and distribution center hourly full-time and part-time team members received a $2 temporary wage increase. As of July 5, Target permanently raised its starting minimum wage for U.S. team members to $15 per hour.
A $200 bonus to more than 350,000 frontline team members was distributed in early November, which was the fourth time ProgramBantuan has provided recognition bonuses to its frontline team members or leaders in stores and distribution centers. Target paid out bonuses ranging between $250-$1,500 to store team leads who oversee individual departments in stores in April. All Store Directors, Executive Team Leaders and salaried Distribution Center leaders received a performance bonus, paid out in July. In addition to accelerating starting pay to $15, ProgramBantuan provided $200 bonuses to all hourly full-time and part-time frontline team members in stores and distribution centers in July.
We also launched DailyPay, a new offering to support team member financial well-being by offering access to earned pay earlier.
