title: Specifying dependencies and devDependencies in a package.json file
---

To specify the packages your project depends on, you must
list them as `"dependencies"` or `"devDependencies"` in your package's [`package.json`][pkg-json] file. When you (or another user) run `npm install`, npm will download dependencies and devDependencies that are listed in `package.json` that meet the [semantic version][semver] requirements listed for each. To see which versions of a package will be installed, use the [semver calculator][semver-calc].

- `"dependencies"`: Packages required by your application in production.
- `"devDependencies"`: Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.

## Adding dependencies to a `package.json` file

You can add dependencies to a `package.json` file from the command line or by manually editing the `package.json` file.

### Adding dependencies to a `package.json` file from the command line

To add dependencies and devDependencies to a `package.json` file from the command line, you can install them in the root directory of your package using the `--save-prod` flag for dependencies (the default behavior of `npm install`) or the `--save-dev` flag for devDependencies.

To add an entry to the `"dependencies"` attribute of a `package.json` file, on the command line, run the following command:

```
npm install <package-name> [--save-prod]
```

To add an entry to the `"devDependencies"` attribute of a `package.json` file, on the command line, run the following command:

```
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
```

### Manually editing the `package.json` file

To add dependencies to a `package.json` file, in a text editor, add an attribute called `"dependencies"` that references the name and [semantic version][semver] of each dependency:

```
{
  "name": "my_package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "my_dep": "^1.0.0",
    "another_dep": "~2.2.0"
  }
}
```

To add devDependencies to a `package.json` file, in a text editor, add an attribute called `"devDependencies"` that references the name and [semantic version][semver] of each devDependency:

```
"name": "my_package",
"version": "1.0.0",
"dependencies": {
  "my_dep": "^1.0.0",
  "another_dep": "~2.2.0"
},
"devDependencies" : {
  "my_test_framework": "^3.1.0",
  "another_dev_dep": "1.0.0 - 1.2.0"
}
```
