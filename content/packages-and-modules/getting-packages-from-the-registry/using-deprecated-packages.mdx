title: Using deprecated packages
---

If you install a package, and it prints a deprecation message, we recommend following the instructions, if possible.

That might mean updating to a new version, or updating your package dependencies.

A deprecation message doesn't always mean the package or version is unusable; it may mean the package is unmaintained and will no longer be updated by the publisher.
