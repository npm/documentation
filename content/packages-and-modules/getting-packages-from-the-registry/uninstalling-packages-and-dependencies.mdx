If you no longer need to use a package in your code, we recommend uninstalling it and removing it from your project's dependencies.

## Uninstalling local packages

### Removing a local package from your node_modules directory

To remove a package from your node_modules directory, on the command line, use the [`uninstall` command][cli-uninstall]. Include the scope if the package is scoped.

This uninstalls a package, completely removing everything npm installed on its behalf.

It also removes the package from the dependencies, devDependencies, optionalDependencies, and peerDependencies objects in your package.json.

Further, if you have an npm-shrinkwrap.json or package-lock.json, npm will update those files as well.

#### Unscoped package

```
npm uninstall <package_name>

```

#### Scoped package

```
npm uninstall <@scope/package_name>
```

### Example

```
npm uninstall lodash
```

### Removing a local package without removing it from package.json

Using the `--no-save` will tell npm not to remove the package from your `package.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, or `package-lock.json` files.

### Example

```
npm uninstall --no-save lodash
```

<Note>

`--save` or `-S` will tell npm to remove the package from your `package.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, and `package-lock.json` files. **This is the default**, but you may need to use this if you have for instance `save=false` in your `.npmrc` file.

</Note>

### Confirming local package uninstallation

To confirm that `npm uninstall` worked correctly, check that the `node_modules` directory no longer contains a directory for the uninstalled package(s).

- Unix system (such as OSX): `ls node_modules`
- Windows systems: `dir node_modules`

## Uninstalling global packages

To uninstall an unscoped global package, on the command line, use the `uninstall` command with the `-g` flag. Include the scope if the package is scoped.

### Unscoped package

```
npm uninstall -g <package_name>
```

### Scoped package

```
npm uninstall -g <@scope/package_name>
```

### Example

For example, to uninstall a package called `jshint`, run:

```
npm uninstall -g jshint
```
