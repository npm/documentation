If you no longer need to use a package in your code, we recommend uninstalling it and removing it from your project's dependencies.

## Uninstalling local packages

### Removing a local package from your node_modules directory

To remove a package from your node_modules directory, on the command line, use the [`uninstall` command][cli-uninstall]. Include the scope if the package is scoped.

#### Unscoped package

```
npm uninstall <package_name>

```

#### Scoped package

```
npm uninstall <@scope/package_name>
```

### Example

```
npm uninstall lodash
```

### Removing a local package from the `package.json` dependencies

To remove a package from the dependencies in `package.json`, use the `--save` flag. Include the scope if the package is scoped.

#### Unscoped package

```
npm uninstall --save <package_name>
```

#### Scoped package

```
npm uninstall --save <@scope/package_name>
```

#### Example

```
npm uninstall --save lodash
```

<Note>

**Note:** If you installed a package as a "devDependency" (i.e. with `--save-dev`), use `--save-dev` to uninstall it:

```
npm uninstall --save-dev package_name
```

</Note>

### Confirming local package uninstallation

To confirm that `npm uninstall` worked correctly, check that the `node_modules` directory no longer contains a directory for the uninstalled package(s).

- Unix system (such as OSX): `ls node_modules`
- Windows systems: `dir node_modules`

## Uninstalling global packages

To uninstall an unscoped global package, on the command line, use the `uninstall` command with the `-g` flag. Include the scope if the package is scoped.

### Unscoped package

```
npm uninstall -g <package_name>
```

### Scoped package

```
npm uninstall -g <@scope/package_name>
```

### Example

For example, to uninstall a package called `jshint`, run:

```
npm uninstall -g jshint
```
