<Note>

**Tip:** If you are using npm 5.2 or higher, we recommend using `npx` to run packages globally.

</Note>

[Installing][cli-install] a package globally allows you to use the code in the package as a set of tools on your local computer.

To download and install packages globally, on the command line, run the following command:

```
npm install -g <package_name>
```

If you get an EACCES permissions error, you may need to reinstall npm with a version manager or manually change npm's default directory. For more information, see "[Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally][perm-errors]".
