title: Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally

If you see an `EACCES` error when you try to [install a package globally][global-install], you can either:

- Reinstall npm with a node version manager (recommended),

  **or**

- Manually change npm's default directory

## Reinstall npm with a node version manager

This is the best way to avoid permissions issues. To reinstall npm with a node version manager, follow the steps in "[Downloading and installing Node.js and npm][install-npm]". You do not need to remove your current version of npm or Node.js before installing a node version manager.

## Manually change npm's default directory

<Note>

**Note:** This section does not apply to Microsoft Windows.

To minimize the chance of permissions errors, you can configure npm to use a different directory. In this example, you will create and use a hidden directory in your home directory.

1. Configure npm to use the new directory path:

   ```
   npm config set prefix ~/.local
   ```

2. In your preferred text editor, open or create a `~/.profile` file and add this line:

   ```
   PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
   ```

   If you are using zsh (which you can find out by running `echo $0`), you will also need to add this line to `~/.zprofile`:

   ```
   source ~/.profile
   ```

3. On the command line, update your system variables:

   ```
   source ~/.profile
   ```

4. To test your new configuration, install a package globally without using `sudo`:

   ```
   npm install -g npm-check-updates
   ```

   And run it:

   ```
   ncu -g
   ```

**npx: an alternative to running global commands**

If you are using npm version 5.2 or greater, you may want to consider [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx) as an alternative way to run global commands, especially if you only need a command occasionally. For more information, see [this article about npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).
