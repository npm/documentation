title: Updating your published package version number
---

When you make significant changes to a published package, we recommend updating the version number to communicate the extent of the changes to others who rely on your code.

<Note>

**Note:** If you have linked a git repository to a package, updating the package version number will also add a tag with the updated release number to the linked git repository.

</Note>

1. To change the version number in `package.json`, on the command line, in the package root directory, run the following command, replacing `<update_type>` with one of the [semantic versioning][semver] release types (patch, major, or minor):

   ```
   npm version <update_type>
   ```

2. Run `npm publish`.

3. Go to your package page (`https://npmjs.com/package/<package>`) to check that the package version has been updated.

For more information on `npm version`, see the [CLI documentation][cli-version].
