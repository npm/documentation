title: Deprecating and undeprecating packages or package versions
---

If you no longer wish to maintain a package, or if you would like to encourage users to update to a new or different version, you can [deprecate][deprecate-cli] it. Deprecating a package or version will print a message to the terminal when a user installs it.

A deprecation warning or message can say anything. You may wish to include a message encouraging users to update to a specific version, or an alternate, supported package.

<Note>

**Note:** We strongly recommend deprecating packages or package versions instead of <a href="/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry">unpublishing</a> them, because unpublishing removes a package from the registry entirely, meaning anyone who relied on it will no longer be able to use it, with no warning.

</Note>

## Deprecating an entire package or a single version of a package

### Deprecating an entire package

Deprecating an entire package will remove it from search results on the npm website, and a deprecation message will also be displayed on the package page.

<Screenshot src="/packages-and-modules/updating-and-managing-your-published-packages/deprecate-package.png" alt="Screenshot of package deprecation" />

To deprecate an entire package, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of your package, and `"<message>"` with your deprecation message:

```
npm deprecate <package-name> "<message>"
```

If you have enabled [two-factor authentication][two-factor-auth], add a one-time password to the command, `--otp=123456` (where *123456* is the code from your authenticator app).

### Deprecating a single version of a package

When you deprecate a version fo a package, a red message will be displayed on that version's package page, similar to deprecating an entire package.

<Screenshot src="/packages-and-modules/updating-and-managing-your-published-packages/deprecate-version.png" alt="Screenshot of package deprecation for a particular version" />

To deprecate a package version, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of your package, `<version>` with your version number, and `"<message>"` with your deprecation message:

```
npm deprecate <package-name>@<version> "<message>"
```

The CLI will also accept version ranges for `<version>`.

If you have two-factor auth, add a one-time password to the command, `--otp=123456` (where *123456* is the code from your authenticator).

## Undeprecating a package or version

To undeprecate a package, replace `"<message>"` with `""` (an empty string) in one of the above commands.

For example, to undeprecate a package version, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of your package, and `<version>` with your version number:

```
npm deprecate <package-name>@<version> ""
```

If you have two-factor auth, add a one-time password to the command, `--otp=123456` (where *123456* is the code from your authenticator).

## Transferring a deprecated package to npm

If you are no longer maintaining a package, but other users depend on it, and you'd like to remove it from your user profile, you can transfer it to the [`@npm`][npm-account] user account, which is owned by the npm registry.

<Note>

**Note:** Once you transfer a package to the npm account, you will no longer be able to update it.

</Note>

To transfer a package to the npm user account, run the following two commands in order, replacing `<user>` with your npm user name, and `<package-name>` with the package you want to transfer:

```
npm owner add npm <package-name>
npm owner rm <user> <package-name>
```

If you have two-factor auth, add a one-time password to the command, `--otp=123456` (where *123456* is the code from your authenticator).
