title: Transferring a package from a user account to another user account
---

As a package owner or maintainer, you can transfer ownership of a package you no longer wish to maintain to another trusted npm user on either the npm website or the command line.

For more information on how npm support handles package name disputes between users, you can refer to npm's [package name dispute policy][dispute-policy].

<Note>

**Note:** If your package is scoped and private, the new package owner must also have a [paid user account](https://www.npmjs.com/pricing). It is possible to transfer ownership of user-scoped packages, however we don't recommend it because it can create some ownership confusion.

## Transferring a package from a user account to another user account on the website

To transfer a package you own or maintain to another user, follow these steps:  

1. Navigate to the package page for the package you want to transfer, replacing `<your-package-name>` with the name of your package:
`https://www.npmjs.com/package/<your-package-name>`.

2. On the package Admin tab, under "Maintainers", enter the npm username of the new maintainer.

3. Click "Invite."

4. To remove yourself as a maintainer, under the maintainers list, click the "x" next to your username.

## Transferring a package from a user account to another user account on the command line

To transfer a package to another npm user using the CLI, run the [`npm owner add`][npm-owner] and `rm` commands in order, replacing `<their-username>` with the other user's npm username, `<your-username>` with your npm username, and `<package-name>` with the package you want to transfer:

```
npm owner add <their-username> <package-name>
npm owner rm <your-username> <package-name>
```

If you have two-factor authentication enabled for writes, add a one-time password to the command, `--otp=123456` (where *123456* is the code from your authenticator application).

```
npm owner add <their-username> <package-name> --otp=123456
npm owner rm <your-username> <package-name> --otp=123456
```
