## How to unpublish

As a package owner or collaborator, if your package has no dependents, you can permanently remove it from the npm registry by using the CLI. You can [unpublish][unpublish-cli] within 72 hours of the initial publish. Beyond 72 hours,so you can still unpublish your package if [it meets certain criteria](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish).

<Note>

**Note:** Removing all the collaborators or teams from the package will not unpublish it.

</Note>

### Unpublishing a single version of a package

To unpublish a single version of a package, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of your package, and `<version>` with your version number:

```
npm unpublish <package-name>@<version>
```

### Unpublishing an entire package

To unpublish an entire package, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of your package:

```
npm unpublish <package-name> -f
```

If you have [two-factor authentication][two-factor-auth] enabled for writes, you will need to add a one-time password to the `unpublish` command, `--otp=123456` (where *123456* is the code from your authenticator app).

## When to unpublish

Unpublishing a package permanently removes the package from the registry so it is no longer available for other users to install. Once a package is unpublished, it cannot be republished. If you've unpublished a package by mistake, we'd recommend publishing again under a different name, or for unpublished versions, bumping the version number and publishing again.

You might want to unpublish a package because you:

* Published something accidentally.
* Wanted to test npm.
* Published content you [didn't intend to be public][oh-no].
* Want to rename a package. (The only way to rename a package is to re-publish it under a new name)

<Note>

**Note:** `package-name@version` is unique, and cannot be reused by unpublishing and re-publishing it. We recommend publishing a minor version update instead.

</Note>

## When to deprecate

If you are no longer interested in maintaining a package, but want it to remain available for users to install, or if your package has dependents, we'd recommend [deprecating][deprecate-cli] it. To learn about how to deprecate a package, see "[Deprecating and undeprecating packages or package versions][deprecate-package]".
