title: Changing package visibility
---

You can change the visibility of a scoped package from the website or command line.

You must be the owner of the user account or organization that owns the package in order to change package visibility.

For more information about package visibility, see "[Package scope, access level, and visibility][pkg-viz]".

<Note>

**Note:** You cannot change the visibility of an unscoped package. Only scoped packages with a paid subscription may be private.

</Note>

## Making a public package private

<Note>

**Note:** Making a package private requires a paid user account or organization. To sign up for a paid user or organization, go to `https://www.npmjs.com/settings/account-name/billing`, replacing `account-name` with the name of your npm user account or organization.

</Note>

If you want to restrict access and visibility for a public package you own, you can make the package private. When you make a package private, its access will be updated immediately and it will be removed from the website within a few minutes of the change.

### Using the website

1. On the [npm website][npmjs-com], go to the package page.
2. On the package page, click **Admin**.
3. Under "Package Access", select "Is Package Private?"
4. Click **Update package settings**.

### Using the command line

To make a public package private on the command line, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of your package:

```
npm access restricted <package-name>
```

For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-documentation/access">`npm access`</a> documentation.
