---

<Note>

**Note:** Vulnerability reporting is currently only available for packages in the public npm registry.

</Note>

If you find a security vulnerability in an npm package (either yours or someone else's), you can report it to the npm Security team to help keep the Javascript ecosystem safe.

## Disclosure timeline

- Vulnerability is reported
- npm Security triages vulnerability report
- npm Security notifies package maintainers
- npm Security publishes security advisory when package maintainers release a fix
- If maintainers are unresponsive after 45 days, npm Security makes the advisory public
