title: Verifying the PGP signature of a package from the npm public registry
---

To ensure the integrity of a package version you download from the npm public registry, you can manually verify the [PGP signature][about-pgp-sig] of the package.

<Note>

**Note:** Since fully verifying signatures on Keybase requires rechecking proofs (which requires network activity) and is therefore expensive, we recommend only verifying signatures if it is absolutely necessary -- for example, when verifying a deploy artifact, or when initially storing a package in your cache.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

1. Install Keybase from https://keybase.io/download
2. Create a Keybase account on https://keybase.io
3. Follow "[npmregistry][npmregistry]" on Keybase.
4. Download a local copy of the npm public registry's [public PGP key][npm-key].

## Verifying npm signatures for the public registry

<Note>

**Note:** The following steps use version 1.4.3 of the `light-cycle` package as an example.

</Note>

1. On the command line, fetch the signature for the package version you want and save it in a file:

   ```
   $ http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/light-cycle | json "versions['1.4.3'].dist.npm-signature" > sig-to-check
   ```

2. Get the integrity field for that version (example below includes response):

   ```
   $ http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/light-cycle | json "versions['1.4.3'].dist.integrity"
   ```

   Example response:

   ```
   sha512-sFcuivsDZ99fY0TbvuRC6CDXB8r/ylafjJAMnbSF0y4EMM1/1DtQo40G2WKz1rBbyiz4SLAc3Wa6yZyC4XSGOQ==
   ```

3. Construct the string that ties the unique package name and version to the integrity string (example below includes response):

   ```
   $ keybase pgp verify --signed-by npmregistry -d sig-to-check -m 'light-cycle@1.4.3:sha512-sFcuivsDZ99fY0TbvuRC6CDXB8r/ylafjJAMnbSF0y4EMM1/1DtQo40G2WKz1rBbyiz4SLAc3Wa6yZyC4XSGOQ=='
   ```

   Example response:

   ```
