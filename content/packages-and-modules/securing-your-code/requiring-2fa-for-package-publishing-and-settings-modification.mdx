title: Requiring 2FA for package publishing and settings modification
---

import shared from '~/shared.js'

All packages now require two-factor authentication (2FA) or a [granular access tokens with bypass 2FA enabled][creating-granular-access-token] for creating and publishing packages.

Modifying a package's settings also requires two-factor authentication (2FA).

For CI/CD workflows, consider using [trusted publishing](/trusted-publishers), which provides secure, token-free publishing that automatically enforces strong authentication without requiring manual token management.

<Note>

**Important notes about granular access tokens:**

- Bypass 2FA configuration is set at token creation
- When **bypass 2FA is disabled**: The system will check account-level and package-level settings to determine if 2FA is required
- When **bypass 2FA is enabled**: The token will bypass all 2FA requirements at all times, regardless of account-level or package-level 2FA settings
- When **Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens** is selected at the package level, granular access tokens cannot be used regardless of their bypass 2FA setting

## Configuring two-factor authentication package settings

4. Under "Publishing access", select the requirements to publish a package.
   1. **Require two-factor authentication or a granular access token with bypass 2fa enabled** (Default)  
      This is the default option for all new packages. With this option, maintainers must have two-factor authentication enabled for their account. If they publish a package interactively, using the `npm publish` command, they will be required to respond to a 2FA prompt when they perform the publish. However, maintainers may also create a [granular access token with bypass 2FA enabled][creating-granular-access-token] and use that for a non-interactive publish.
   2. **Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens** (Recommended) With this option, a maintainer must have two-factor authentication enabled for their account, and they must publish interactively. Maintainers will be required to respond to a 2FA prompt when they perform the publish. Granular access tokens cannot be used to publish packages, regardless of their bypass 2FA setting.
