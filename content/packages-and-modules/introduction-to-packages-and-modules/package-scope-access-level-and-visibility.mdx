title: npm package scope, access level, and visibility
---

Visibility of npm packages depends on the scope (namespace) in which the package is contained, and the access level (private or public) set for the package.

<span class="bold">Note:</span> To create organization-scoped packages, you must first create an organization. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-an-organization">Creating an organization</a>".
