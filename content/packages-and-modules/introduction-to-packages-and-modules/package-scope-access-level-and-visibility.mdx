title: npm package scope, access level, and visibility
---

Visibility of npm packages depends on the scope (namespace) in which the package is contained, and the access level (private or public) set for the package.

<Note>

**Note:** To create organization-scoped packages, you must first create an organization. For more information, see "[Creating an organization](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-an-organization)".
