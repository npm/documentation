The npm registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules. Read on to understand how they differ and how they interact.

## About packages

A **package** is a file or directory that is described by a `package.json` file. A package must contain a `package.json` file in order to be published to the npm registry. For more information on creating a `package.json` file, see "[Creating a package.json file][pkg-json]".

Packages can be unscoped or scoped to a user or organization, and scoped packages can be private or public. For more information, see
- "[About scopes][about-scopes]"
- "[About private packages][private-pkgs]"
- "[Package scope, access level, and visibility][pkg-viz]"

### About package formats

A package is any of the following:

* a) A folder containing a program described by a `package.json` file.
* b) A gzipped tarball containing (a).
* c) A URL that resolves to (b).
* d) A `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry with (c).
* e) A `<name>@<tag>` that points to (d).
* f) A `<name>` that has a `latest` tag satisfying (e).
* g) A `git` url that, when cloned, results in (a).

### npm package git URL formats

Git URLs used for npm packages can be formatted in the following ways:

- `git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish`
- `git+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish`
- `git+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish`
- `git+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish`

The `commit-ish` can be any tag, sha, or branch that can be supplied as
an argument to `git checkout`. The default `commit-ish` is `master`.

## About modules

A **module** is any file or directory in the `node_modules` directory that can be loaded by the Node.js `require()` function.

To be loaded by the Node.js `require()` function, a module must be one of the following:

* A folder with a `package.json` file containing a `"main"` field.
* A JavaScript file.

<Note>

**Note:** Since modules are not required to have a `package.json` file, not all modules are packages. Only modules that have a `package.json` file are also packages.

</Note>

In the context of a Node program, the `module` is also the thing that
was loaded *from* a file. For example, in the following program:

    var req = require('request')

we might say that "The variable `req` refers to the `request` module".
