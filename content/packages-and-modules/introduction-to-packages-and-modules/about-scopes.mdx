<div class="note">

<span class="bold">Note:</span> You must be using npm version 2 or greater to use scopes. To upgrade to the latest version of npm, on the command line, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install npm@latest -g</code>

</div>

When you sign up for an npm user account or create an organization, you are granted a scope that matches your user or organization name. You can use this scope as a namespace for related packages.

A scope allows you to create a package with the same name as a package created by another user or organization without conflict.

When listed as a dependent in a `package.json` file, scoped packages are preceded by their scope name. The scope name is everything between the `@` and the slash:

* **"npm" scope:**
```
@npm/package-name
```
* **"npmcorp" scope:**
```
@npmcorp/package-name
```

To create and publish public scoped packages, see "[Creating and publishing scoped public packages][create-public-pkg]".

To create and publish private scoped packages, see "[Creating and publishing private packages][create-private-pkg]".

## Scopes and package visibility

- Unscoped packages are always public.
- [Private packages][about-priv-pkg] are always scoped.
- Scoped packages are private by default; you must pass a command-line flag when publishing to make them public.

For more information on package scope and visibility, see "[Package scope, access level, and visibility][pkg-viz]".
