title: About public packages
---

As an npm user or organization member, you can create and publish public packages that anyone can download and use in their own projects.

* **Unscoped** public packages exist in the global public registry namespace and can be referenced in a `package.json` file with the package name alone: `package-name`.
* **Scoped** public packages belong to a user or organization and must be preceded by the user or organization name when included as a dependency in a `package.json` file:
  * `@username/package-name`
  * `@org-name/package-name`
