### Synopsis

```bash
npm bin
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Print the folder where npm will install executables.

### Configuration

#### `global`

- Default: false
- Type: Boolean

Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix` folder instead of the current working directory. See [folders](/cli/v8/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior.

- packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead of the current working directory.
- bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
- man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`
