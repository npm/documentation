### Synopsis

```bash
npm star [<package-spec>...]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

"Starring" a package means that you have some interest in it. It's a vaguely positive way to show that you care.

It's a boolean thing. Starring repeatedly has no additional effect.

### More

There's also these extra commands to help you manage your favorite packages:

#### Unstar

You can also "unstar" a package using [`npm unstar`](/cli/v8/commands/npm-unstar)

"Unstarring" is the same thing, but in reverse.

#### Listing stars

You can see all your starred packages using [`npm stars`](/cli/v8/commands/npm-stars)

### Configuration

#### `registry`

- Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
- Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

#### `unicode`

- Default: false on windows, true on mac/unix systems with a unicode locale, as defined by the `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, or `LANG` environment variables.
- Type: Boolean

When set to true, npm uses unicode characters in the tree output. When false, it uses ascii characters instead of unicode glyphs.

#### `otp`

- Default: null
- Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
