### Synopsis

```bash
npm set <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...] (See `npm config`)
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Set a value in the npm configuration

### Configuration

#### `global`

- Default: false
- Type: Boolean

Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix` folder instead of the current working directory. See [folders](/cli/v11/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior.

- packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead of the current working directory.
- bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
- man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`

#### `location`

- Default: "user" unless `--global` is passed, which will also set this value to "global"
- Type: "global", "user", or "project"

When passed to `npm config` this refers to which config file to use.

When set to "global" mode, packages are installed into the `prefix` folder instead of the current working directory. See [folders](/cli/v11/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior.

- packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead of the current working directory.
- bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
- man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`
