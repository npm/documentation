### Synopsis

```bash
npm dist-tag add <pkg>@<version> [<tag>]
npm dist-tag rm <pkg> <tag>
npm dist-tag ls [<pkg>]

aliases: dist-tags
```

### Description

Add, remove, and enumerate distribution tags on a package:

* add: Tags the specified version of the package with the specified tag, or
  the `--tag` config if not specified. If you have two-factor
  authentication on auth-and-writes then you’ll need to include a one-time
  password on the command line with `--otp <one-time password>`, or at the
  OTP prompt.

* rm: Clear a tag that is no longer in use from the package. If you have
  two-factor authentication on auth-and-writes then you’ll need to include
  a one-time password on the command line with `--otp <one-time password>`,
  or at the OTP prompt.

* ls: Show all of the dist-tags for a package, defaulting to the package in
  the current prefix. This is the default action if none is specified.

A tag can be used when installing packages as a reference to a version instead
of using a specific version number:

```bash
npm install <name>@<tag>
```

When installing dependencies, a preferred tagged version may be specified:

```bash
npm install --tag <tag>
```

(This also applies to any other commands that resolve and install
dependencies, such as `npm dedupe`, `npm update`, and `npm audit fix`.)

Publishing a package sets the `latest` tag to the published version unless the
`--tag` option is used. For example, `npm publish --tag=beta`.

By default, `npm install <pkg>` (without any `@<version>` or `@<tag>`
specifier) installs the `latest` tag.

### Purpose

Tags can be used to provide an alias instead of version numbers.

For example, a project might choose to have multiple streams of development
and use a different tag for each stream, e.g., `stable`, `beta`, `dev`,
`canary`.

By default, the `latest` tag is used by npm to identify the current version
of a package, and `npm install <pkg>` (without any `@<version>` or `@<tag>`
specifier) installs the `latest` tag. Typically, projects only use the
`latest` tag for stable release versions, and use other tags for unstable
versions such as prereleases.

The `next` tag is used by some projects to identify the upcoming version.

Other than `latest`, no tag has any special significance to npm itself.

### Caveats

This command used to be known as `npm tag`, which only created new tags,
and so had a different syntax.

Tags must share a namespace with version numbers, because they are
specified in the same slot: `npm install <pkg>@<version>` vs
`npm install <pkg>@<tag>`.

Tags that can be interpreted as valid semver ranges will be rejected. For
example, `v1.4` cannot be used as a tag, because it is interpreted by
semver as `>=1.4.0 <1.5.0`.  See <https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6082>.

The simplest way to avoid semver problems with tags is to use tags that do
not begin with a number or the letter `v`.

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option.

Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result to selecting all of the
  nested workspaces)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `workspaces`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Enable running a command in the context of **all** the configured
workspaces.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.
