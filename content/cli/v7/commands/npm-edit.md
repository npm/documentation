### Synopsis

```bash
npm edit <pkg>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Selects a dependency in the current project and opens the package folder in
the default editor (or whatever you've configured as the npm `editor`
config -- see [`npm-config`](npm-config).)

After it has been edited, the package is rebuilt so as to pick up any
changes in compiled packages.

For instance, you can do `npm install connect` to install connect
into your package, and then `npm edit connect` to make a few
changes to your locally installed copy.
