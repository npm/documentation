### Synopsis

```bash
npm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease [--preid=<prerelease-id>] | from-git]

'npm [-v | --version]' to print npm version
'npm view <pkg> version' to view a package's published version
'npm ls' to inspect current package/dependency versions
```

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
#### `allow-same-version`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prevents throwing an error when `npm version` is used to set the new version
to the same value as the current version.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `commit-hooks`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Run git commit hooks when using the `npm version` command.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `git-tag-version`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tag the commit when using the `npm version` command.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output.

* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON.parse() before
  saving them to your `package.json`.

Not supported by all npm commands.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `preid`

* Default: ""
* Type: String

The "prerelease identifier" to use as a prefix for the "prerelease" part of
a semver. Like the `rc` in `1.2.0-rc.8`.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `sign-git-tag`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, then the `npm version` command will tag the version using
`-s` to add a signature.

Note that git requires you to have set up GPG keys in your git configs for
this to work properly.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option.

Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result to selecting all of the
  nested workspaces)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `workspaces`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Enable running a command in the context of **all** the configured
workspaces.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

### Description

Run this in a package directory to bump the version and write the new data
back to `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and, if present,
`npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

The `newversion` argument should be a valid semver string, a valid second
argument to [semver.inc](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#functions) (one
of `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `prepatch`, `preminor`, `premajor`,
`prerelease`), or `from-git`. In the second case, the existing version will
be incremented by 1 in the specified field.  `from-git` will try to read
the latest git tag, and use that as the new npm version.

If run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag.  This
behavior is controlled by `git-tag-version` (see below), and can be
disabled on the command line by running `npm --no-git-tag-version version`.
It will fail if the working directory is not clean, unless the `-f` or
`--force` flag is set.

If supplied with `-m` or `--message` config option, npm will use it as a
commit message when creating a version commit.  If the `message` config
contains `%s` then that will be replaced with the resulting version number.
For example:

```bash
npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"
```

If the `sign-git-tag` config is set, then the tag will be signed using the
`-s` flag to git.  Note that you must have a default GPG key set up in your
git config for this to work properly.  For example:

```bash
$ npm config set sign-git-tag true
$ npm version patch

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "isaacs (http://blog.izs.me/) <i@izs.me>"
2048-bit RSA key, ID 6C481CF6, created 2010-08-31

Enter passphrase:
```

If `preversion`, `version`, or `postversion` are in the `scripts` property
of the package.json, they will be executed as part of running `npm
version`.

The exact order of execution is as follows:

1. Check to make sure the git working directory is clean before we get
   started.  Your scripts may add files to the commit in future steps.
   This step is skipped if the `--force` flag is set.
2. Run the `preversion` script. These scripts have access to the old
   `version` in package.json.  A typical use would be running your full
   test suite before deploying.  Any files you want added to the commit
   should be explicitly added using `git add`.
3. Bump `version` in `package.json` as requested (`patch`, `minor`,
   `major`, etc).
4. Run the `version` script. These scripts have access to the new `version`
   in package.json (so they can incorporate it into file headers in
   generated files for example).  Again, scripts should explicitly add
   generated files to the commit using `git add`.
5. Commit and tag.
6. Run the `postversion` script. Use it to clean up the file system or
   automatically push the commit and/or tag.

Take the following example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preversion": "npm test",
    "version": "npm run build && git add -A dist",
    "postversion": "git push && git push --tags && rm -rf build/temp"
  }
}
```

This runs all your tests and proceeds only if they pass. Then runs your
`build` script, and adds everything in the `dist` directory to the commit.
After the commit, it pushes the new commit and tag up to the server, and
deletes the `build/temp` directory.
