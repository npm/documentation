### Synopsis

```bash
npm star [<pkg>...]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

"Starring" a package means that you have some interest in it.  It's
a vaguely positive way to show that you care.

It's a boolean thing. Starring repeatedly has no additional effect.

### More

There's also these extra commands to help you manage your favorite packages:

#### Unstar

You can also "unstar" a package using [`npm unstar`](/cli/v7/commands/npm-unstar)

"Unstarring" is the same thing, but in reverse.

#### Listing stars

You can see all your starred packages using [`npm stars`](/cli/v7/commands/npm-stars)
