### Synopsis

```bash
npm explore <pkg> [ -- <command>]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Spawn a subshell in the directory of the installed package specified.

If a command is specified, then it is run in the subshell, which then
immediately terminates.

This is particularly handy in the case of git submodules in the
`node_modules` folder:

```bash
npm explore some-dependency -- git pull origin master
```

Note that the package is *not* automatically rebuilt afterwards, so be
sure to use `npm rebuild <pkg>` if you make any changes.
