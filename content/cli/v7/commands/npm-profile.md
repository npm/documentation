### Synopsis

```bash
npm profile get [--json|--parseable] [<property>]
npm profile set [--json|--parseable] <property> <value>
npm profile set password
npm profile enable-2fa [auth-and-writes|auth-only]
npm profile disable-2fa
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Change your profile information on the registry.  Note that this command
depends on the registry implementation, so third-party registries may not
support this interface.

* `npm profile get [<property>]`: Display all of the properties of your
  profile, or one or more specific properties.  It looks like:

```bash
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| name            | example                   |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| email           | me@example.com (verified) |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| two factor auth | auth-and-writes           |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| fullname        | Example User              |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| homepage        |                           |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| freenode        |                           |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| twitter         |                           |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| github          |                           |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| created         | 2015-02-26T01:38:35.892Z  |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
| updated         | 2017-10-02T21:29:45.922Z  |
+-----------------+---------------------------+
```

* `npm profile set <property> <value>`: Set the value of a profile
  property. You can set the following properties this way: email, fullname,
  homepage, freenode, twitter, github

* `npm profile set password`: Change your password.  This is interactive,
  you'll be prompted for your current password and a new password.  You'll
  also be prompted for an OTP if you have two-factor authentication
  enabled.

* `npm profile enable-2fa [auth-and-writes|auth-only]`: Enables two-factor
  authentication. Defaults to `auth-and-writes` mode. Modes are:
  * `auth-only`: Require an OTP when logging in or making changes to your
    account's authentication.  The OTP will be required on both the website
    and the command line.
  * `auth-and-writes`: Requires an OTP at all the times `auth-only` does,
    and also requires one when publishing a module, setting the `latest`
    dist-tag, or changing access via `npm access` and `npm owner`.

* `npm profile disable-2fa`: Disables two-factor authentication.

### Details

Some of these commands may not be available on non npmjs.com registries.

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
#### `registry`

* Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output.

* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON.parse() before
  saving them to your `package.json`.

Not supported by all npm commands.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `parseable`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Output parseable results from commands that write to standard output. For
`npm search`, this will be tab-separated table format.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.

<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
