### Synopsis

```bash
npm ci
```

### Description

This command is similar to [`npm install`](/cli/v7/commands/npm-install), except
it's meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms,
continuous integration, and deployment -- or any situation where you want
to make sure you're doing a clean install of your dependencies.

`npm ci` will be significantly faster when:

- There is a `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.
- The `node_modules` folder is missing or empty.

In short, the main differences between using `npm install` and `npm ci` are:

* The project **must** have an existing `package-lock.json` or
  `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.
* If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in `package.json`,
  `npm ci` will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock.
* `npm ci` can only install entire projects at a time: individual
  dependencies cannot be added with this command.
* If a `node_modules` is already present, it will be automatically removed
  before `npm ci` begins its install.
* It will never write to `package.json` or any of the package-locks:
  installs are essentially frozen.

### Example

Make sure you have a package-lock and an up-to-date install:

```bash
$ cd ./my/npm/project
$ npm install
added 154 packages in 10s
$ ls | grep package-lock
```

Run `npm ci` in that project

```bash
$ npm ci
added 154 packages in 5s
```

Configure Travis to build using `npm ci` instead of `npm install`:

```bash
# .travis.yml
install:
- npm ci
# keep the npm cache around to speed up installs
cache:
  directories:
  - "$HOME/.npm"
```

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When "true" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes. See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.

Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `script-shell`

* Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd.exe' on Windows
* Type: null or String

The shell to use for scripts run with the `npm exec`, `npm run` and `npm
init <pkg>` commands.
