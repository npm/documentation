### Synopsis

```bash
npm login
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Verify a user in the specified registry, and save the credentials to the `.npmrc` file. If no registry is specified, the default registry will be used (see [`config`](/cli/v9/using-npm/config)).

When using `legacy` for your `auth-type`, the username and password, are read in from prompts.

To reset your password, go to [https://www.npmjs.com/forgot](https://www.npmjs.com/forgot)

To change your email address, go to [https://www.npmjs.com/email-edit](https://www.npmjs.com/email-edit)

You may use this command multiple times with the same user account to authorize on a new machine. When authenticating on a new machine, the username, password and email address must all match with your existing record.

### Configuration

#### `registry`

- Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
- Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

#### `scope`

- Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or ""
- Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry.

Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry.mycorp.com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future installation of packages specified according to the pattern `@mycorp/package`.

This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package.

```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named "@foo/whatever",
# instead of just named "whatever"
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```

#### `auth-type`

- Default: "web"
- Type: "legacy" or "web"

What authentication strategy to use with `login`. Note that if an `otp` config is given, this value will always be set to `legacy`.
