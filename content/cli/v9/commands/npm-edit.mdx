### Synopsis

```bash
npm edit <pkg>[/<subpkg>...]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Selects a dependency in the current project and opens the package folder in the default editor (or whatever you've configured as the npm `editor` config -- see [`npm-config`](npm-config).)

After it has been edited, the package is rebuilt so as to pick up any changes in compiled packages.

For instance, you can do `npm install connect` to install connect into your package, and then `npm edit connect` to make a few changes to your locally installed copy.

### Configuration

#### `editor`

- Default: The EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables, or '%SYSTEMROOT%\notepad.exe' on Windows, or 'vi' on Unix systems
- Type: String

The command to run for `npm edit` and `npm config edit`.
