### Synopsis

```bash
npm deprecate <package-spec> <message>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

This command will update the npm registry entry for a package, providing a deprecation warning to all who attempt to install it.

It works on [version ranges](https://semver.npmjs.com/) as well as specific versions, so you can do something like this:

```bash
npm deprecate my-thing@"< 0.2.3" "critical bug fixed in v0.2.3"
```

SemVer ranges passed to this command are interpreted such that they _do_ include prerelease versions. For example:

```bash
npm deprecate my-thing@1.x "1.x is no longer supported"
```

In this case, a version `my-thing@1.0.0-beta.0` will also be deprecated.

You must be the package owner to deprecate something. See the `owner` and `adduser` help topics.

To un-deprecate a package, specify an empty string (`""`) for the `message` argument. Note that you must use double quotes with no space between them to format an empty string.

### Configuration

#### `registry`

- Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
- Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

#### `otp`

- Default: null
- Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
