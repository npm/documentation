<Note>

**Note:** This article only applies to users of the public npm registry.

If you need to install and publish private packages, you can upgrade to a paid user account plan. Our paid user account plan costs $7 per month. For more information, see the "npm account" column on our [pricing page](https://www.npmjs.com/pricing).

Your paid plan and billing cycle will start when you submit your credit card information, and you will be charged for the first month immediately.
