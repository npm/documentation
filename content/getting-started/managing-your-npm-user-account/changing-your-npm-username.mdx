title: Changing your npm username

import shared from '../../../src/shared.js'

It is not currently possible to change your npm username.  You'll need to
create a new account and migrate the data to the new account manually.

1. Create a [new user account](/creating-a-new-npm-user-account) with your desired username
2. [Transfer your packages](/transferring-a-package-from-a-user-account-to-another-user-account) to your new account.
3. If you are a member of any [organizations](/organizations), ask the organization administrator to [invite your new account to the organization](/adding-members-to-your-organization).
4. Delete your [original account](/deleting-your-npm-user-account).  Note that this is permanent, and after 30 days, this account name is available for other people to claim.
