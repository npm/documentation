* Two-factor authentication status

## Managing user account profile settings from the command line

<Note>

**Note:** Your npm client must be version 5.5.1 or higher to change your account settings from the CLI. To update to the latest version of npm, on the command line, run `npm install npm@latest -g`

### Updating user account profile settings from the command line

From the CLI, you can change the following properties for your user account:

* `email`
* `two-factor auth`
* `fullname`
* `homepage`
* `freenode`
* `twitter`
* `github`
* `password`

1. On the command line, type the following command, replacing `property` with the name of the property, and `value` with the new value:

   ```
   npm profile set <prop> <value>
   ```

2. When prompted, provide your current password.

3. If you have enabled two-factor authentication on your account, when prompted, enter a one-time password.

For more details, see the `profile` [command line documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/profile).

#### Setting a password from the command line

1. On the command line, type the following command:

  ```
  npm profile set password
  ```

2. When prompted, provide your current password.

3. When prompted, type a new password.

<Note>

To protect your account, when you reset your password from the command line, it must:

* be longer than 10 characters
* not contain part of your username
* not be on [this list of common passwords](https://www.npmjs.com/signup/common-passwords)
* not be in the "[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)" breach database

</Note>

#### Configuring two-factor authentication from the command line

Enabling two-factor authentication on your account helps protect against unauthorized access to your account and packages.

To enable, configure, and disable two-factor authentication from the command line, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication](/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-2fa-from-the-command-line)".
