When a package fails to install or publish, the npm CLI will generate an `npm-debug.log` file. This log file can help you (and [npm Support][support]) figure out what went wrong.

If you need to generate a `npm-debug.log` file, you can run one of these commands.

For installing packages:

```
npm install --timing
```

For publishing packages:

```
npm publish --timing
```

You can find the `npm-debug.log` file in your `.npm` directory. To find your `.npm` directory, use `npm config get cache`.

If you use a CI environment, your logs are likely located elsewhere. For example, in Travis CI, you can find them in the `/home/travis/build` directory.

<Note>
<><strong>npm Enterprise users:</strong> If you need to {shared['contact-enterprise-support'].text}, we recommend attaching the entire contents of the `npm-debug.log` file or copying the contents into the body of the message, so that we can more easily diagnose the problem.</>
