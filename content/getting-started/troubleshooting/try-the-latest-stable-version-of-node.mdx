If you're experiencing issues while using a version of node which is unsupported or unstable (odd numbered versions e.g. 0.7.x, 0.9.x, 0.11.x), it's very possible your issue will be fixed by simply using the [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) version of node.

## See what version of node you're running:

```
node -v
```

### Updating node on Linux

For some Linux distributions (Debian/Ubuntu and RedHat/CentOS), the latest node version provided by the distribution may lag behind the stable version.  Here are [instructions from NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) on getting the latest node.

### Updating node on Windows

Install the latest msi from <https://nodejs.org/en/download>

### Updating node on OSX

Install the latest package from <https://nodejs.org/en/download>

or if you are using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install node
```

### An easy way to stay up-to-date

Node.js has lots of versions, and its development is very active. As a good practice to manage the various versions, we recommend that you use a version manager for your Node.js installation. There are many great options, here are a few:

+ [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
+ [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)
+ [n](https://github.com/tj/n)
+ [nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave)
+ [nodebrew](https://github.com/hokaccha/nodebrew)
