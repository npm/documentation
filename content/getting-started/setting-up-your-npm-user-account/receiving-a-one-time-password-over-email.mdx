For your security, npm may require additional verification to allow you to log in to your account.  If you do not have [two-factor authentication](configuring-two-factor-authentication) enabled, you may be asked to verify yourself with a one-time password sent to the email address configured for your account.

## Logging in with a one-time password

1. <>{shared['user-login'].text}</>

   <>{shared['user-login'].image}</>

2. You'll be prompted for a one-time password that was sent to your email.

3. Check your email account for an email from npm containing your one-time password (the subject will begin "OTP for logging in to your account").

4. Enter the digits from your email in your one-time password field.

## Enabling two-factor authentication

To avoid this additional login step, with a one-time password sent to you via e-mail, you can configure [two-factor authentication with a device](/configuring-two-factor-authentication) (2FA) instead.

## Unable to access email

If you are unable to access the email linked to your npm account, you can submit a support ticket to reset this email address.

2. Under the "Login Verification" form, click **Try recovering your account**.

3. <>{shared['start-account-recovery'].text}</>
