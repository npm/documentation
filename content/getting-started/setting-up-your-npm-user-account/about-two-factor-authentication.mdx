Two-factor authentication (2FA) protects against unauthorized access to your account by confirming your identity using:

* something you know (such as your username and password)
* something you have (such as a phone or tablet)

When you enable 2FA, we will prompt you for a unique one-time password when you perform certain actions on your account or on packages to which you have write access, depending on your 2FA configuration.

<Note>

**Note:** Two-factor authentication provides the best possible security for your account against attackers. We strongly recommend enabling 2FA on your account as soon as possible after you sign up.

## Two-factor authentication modes on npm

Two-factor authentication on npm can be enabled for authorization only, or authorization and writes.

### Authorization only

If you enable 2FA for authorization only, we will request a one-time password for certain authorized actions.

| Action                                            | CLI command                        |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Log in to npm                                     | `npm login`                        |
| Change profile settings (including your password) | `npm profile set`                  |
| Change 2FA modes for your user account            | `npm profile enable-2fa auth-only` |
| Disable 2FA for your user account                 | `npm profile disable-2fa`          |

### Authorization and writes

If you enable 2FA for authorization and writes, we will request a one-time password for certain authorized actions, as well as write actions.
