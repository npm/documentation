The npm command line interface (CLI) is released on a regular cadence. We recommend installing the release that supports your workflow:

- [latest release](#the-latest-release-of-npm): the most recent stable version.
- [next release](#the-next-release-of-npm): the version in current development.

## The `latest` release of npm

The `latest` release of npm is the most recent stable version. When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed. However, npm is released more frequently than Node.js, so to install the latest stable version of npm, on the command line, run:

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

## The `next` release of npm

<Note>

The `next` release of npm may contain features that do not match the features ultimately released in the `latest` stable version of npm.

More.

</Note>

The `next` release of npm is the version undergoing current development; it has the latest changes and newest set of features.

The `next` release of npm is the most recent unreleased version of npm that is eventually released as the `latest` version. You may want to update your npm client to the `next` release to test your packages against it before `latest` is released.

To update to the `next` release of npm, on the command line, run:

```
npm install npm@next -g
```

<Note>

Depending on the development cycle, `npm install npm@next -g` may reinstall the `latest` release of npm.
