To install private npm packages in a Docker container, you will need to use Docker's build-time variables.

## Background: runtime variables

You cannot install private npm packages in a Docker container using only runtime variables.  Consider the following Dockerfile:

```
FROM node

COPY package.json package.json  
RUN npm install

# Add your source files
COPY . .  
CMD npm start  
```

Which will use the official [Node.js](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) image, copy the `package.json` into our container, installs dependencies, copies the source files and runs the start command as specified in the `package.json`.

In order to install private packages, you may think that we could just add a line before we run `npm install`, using the [ENV parameter](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env):

```
ENV NPM_TOKEN=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

However, this doesn't work as you would expect, because you want the npm install to occur when you run `docker build`, and in this instance, `ENV` variables aren't used, they are set for runtime only.

Instead of run-time variables, you must use a different way of passing environment variables to Docker, available since Docker 1.9: the [ARG parameter](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg).

## Create and check in a project-specific .npmrc file

A complete example that will allow you to use `--build-arg` to pass in your NPM_TOKEN requires adding a `.npmrc` file to the project.

Use a project-specific `.npmrc` file with a variable for your token to securely authenticate your Docker image with npm.

1. In the root directory of your project, create a custom <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-documentation/files/npmrc">`.npmrc`</a> file with the following contents:

   ```
   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
   ```

   **Note:** that you are specifying a literal value of `${NPM_TOKEN}`.  The npm cli will replace this value with the contents of the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable.  Do **not** put a token in this file.

2. Check in the `.npmrc` file.

## Update the Dockerfile

The Dockerfile that takes advantage of this has a few more lines in it than the earlier example that allows us to use the `.npmrc` file and the `ARG` parameter:

```
FROM node

ARG NPM_TOKEN  
COPY .npmrc .npmrc  
COPY package.json package.json  
RUN npm install  
RUN rm -f .npmrc

# Add your source files
COPY . .  
CMD npm start
```

This adds the expected `ARG NPM_TOKEN`, but also copies the `.npmrc` file, and removes it when `npm install` completes.

## Build the Docker image

To build the image using the above Dockerfile and the npm authentication token, you can run the following command. Note the `.` at the end to give `docker build` the current directory as an argument.

```
docker build --build-arg NPM_TOKEN=${NPM_TOKEN} .
```

This will build the Docker image with the current `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable, so you can run `npm install` inside your container as the current logged-in user.

<Note>

**Note:** Even if you delete the `.npmrc` file, it will be kept in the commit history. To clean your secrets entirely, make sure to squash them.

**Note:** You may commit the `.npmrc` file under a different name, e.g. `.npmrc.docker` to prevent local build from using it.

**Note:** You may need to specify a working directory different from the default `/`  otherwise some frameworks like Angular will fail.
