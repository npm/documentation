3. In the **Token name** field, enter a name for your token.

4. (Optional) In the **Description** field, enter a description for your token.

5. In the **Expiration** field, enter a token expiration period. The date must be at least 1 day in the future.

6. (Optional) In the **Allowed IP Ranges** field, enter IP address ranges to restrict your access token to. You must use [CIDR][cidr-wiki] notation to enter IP address ranges. To add more than one allowed IP range, click **Add IP Range** and enter an IP range in the new text field.

7. (Optional) In the **Packages and scopes** section, configure your token's access to packages and scopes.
   - In the **Permissions** dropdown menu, select **No access**, **Read-only**, or **Read and write**.
   - Under **Select Packages**, select either:
     - **All Packages** to grant the token access to all packages the user account has access to.
     - **Only select packages and scopes** to choose up to 50 specific packages or scopes to give the token access to. Then select specific packages or scopes from the dropdown menu.

8. (Optional) In the **Organizations** section, configure your token's access to organizations.
   - In the **Permissions** dropdown menu, select **No access**, **Read-only**, or **Read and write**.
   - Under **Select organizations**, select the organizations you want to grant your token access to.

   _**Note**: When you give a token access to an organization, the token can only be used for managing organization settings and teams or users associated with the organization. It does not give the token the right to publish packages managed by the organization._

9. Review the token summary, then click **Generate Token**.

## Viewing access tokens
