title: npm Business Solution Terms
---

Version 4.2.1

These terms and the **Quote** sent by _npm_ or presented to _Customer_ through npmjs.com or AWS Marketplace make up an agreement between **npm** and **Customer**.

## Background

- _npm_ develops computer software and services for installing, managing, and sharing **Packages** of computer code and data.

- _npm_'s command-line interface, or **CLI**, allows programmers to create, download, and share _Packages_ through online repositories called registries. _npm_ licenses the _CLI_ on _Open-Source Terms_, so anyone can use it free of charge.

- _npm_ hosts the world's largest and most-used registry of _Packages_, the **npm Public Registry**. All _Packages_ in the _npm Public Registry_ are public, and anyone can download them.

- Most software developers search and discover _Packages_ in the _npm Public Registry_ through the **npm Website**, https://www.npmjs.com. Developers also visit the _npm Website_ to create and manage accounts for publishing _Packages_.

- _npm_ uses its familiarity and expertise with the _CLI_, _npm Public Registry_, and _npm Website_ to develop and offer software services for sharing _Packages_ privately within organizations, and for performing security analysis of _Packages_ that organizations use.

- **npm Orgs** gives organizations access to, and control over, a named space, or **Scope**, for public and private _Packages_ of their own, on the same infrastructure as the _npm Public Registry_.

- **npm Enterprise** gives organizations access to their own, private registry, hosted on infrastructure separate from the _npm Public Registry_.

- _npm_ publishes **Documentation** for the _CLI_, _npm Orgs_, and _npm Enterprise_ at https://docs.npmjs.com/.

- This is an agreement for _npm_ to provide either _npm Orgs_ or _npm Enterprise_ for _Customer_, as **Customer's Solution**.

- This agreement governs use of _Customer's Solution_. _Customer_'s use of the _npm Public Registry_, _npm Website_, and any other _npm_ services is governed by the terms of use for those offerings.

## npm's Obligations

### Host Customer's Solution

_npm_ agrees to provide _Customer's Solution_ so that _Customer Personnel_ can use the _Feature Set_ via the Internet, with computers and software that meet the requirements set out in the _Documentation_.

### Isolate npm Enterprise

If _Customer's Solution_ is _npm Enterprise_, _npm_ agrees to run _npm Enterprise_ for _Customer_ in its own, isolated virtual environment, separated from environments used to run _npm Enterprise_ for other customers.

### Provide a Scope

If _Customer's Solution_ is _npm Orgs_, _npm_ agrees to provide _Customer_ its own, uniquely named _Scope_ for _Packages_ on _npm Public Registry_ infrastructure. If _Customer_ received the _Quote_ and selected a _Scope_ name through the _npm Website_, that will be the name of _Customer_'s _Scope_. Otherwise, _npm_ and _Customer_ will collaborate to identify an available _Scope_ name for _Customer_.

### Maintain Customer's Solution

_npm_ agrees to update _Customer's Solution_ with software updates and fixes made generally available to other customers paying for the same solution. Updates and fixes do not include new or preexisting add-on features and complimentary services for which _npm_ charges additional fees.

### Allow High-Volume Use of the npm Public Registry

While this agreement continues and _Customer_ has paid all fees as required by this agreement, _npm_ waives the rule of its terms of service for the _npm Public Registry_ that prohibits _Customer_ from making an unreasonable volume of requests. _Customer_ may make up to 500,000,000 requests to the _npm Public Registry_ in any rolling thirty-calendar-day period, through _Customer's Solution_ or otherwise. This agreement does not change the terms of service for the _npm Public Registry_ in any other way.

### Publish Documentation

_npm_ agrees to publish the _Documentation_ so _Customer_ personnel can read it on the World Wide Web.

### Maintain the CLI

_npm_ agrees to publish a version of the _CLI_ compatible with _Customer's Solution_, free of charge, on _Open-Source Terms_.

### List Customer as a Supporter

If the _Quote_ specifies a promotional tier, then _npm_ agrees to display _Customer_'s logotype with those of other sponsors of the same tier on the _npm Website_.

### Keep Customer Data Confidential

_npm_ agrees not to access, use, or disclose _Customer Data_ without _Permission_, except:

- as needed to host _Customer's Solution_

- to monitor use of _Customer's Solution_ to prevent, detect, and mitigate breach of this agreement

- to improve _Customer's Solution_ and the efficiency with which _npm_ provides it, to _Customer_ and others

- to respond to _Technical Support Requests_

### Take Security Precautions

_npm_ agrees to take industry-standard security precautions to defend _Customer's Solution_ from malicious technical attack and _Data Breach_. _npm_ does not guarantee that _Customer's Solution_ will be completely free of software bugs or configuration errors affecting security, or completely secure from all possible technical attack.

### Provide Technical Support

#### Technical Support

_npm_ agrees to task _npm_ **Support Personnel** with responding to **Technical Support Requests** from _Customer Personnel_. _Technical Support Requests_ must be opened at https://npmjs.com/support/.

#### Scope of Technical Support

_npm_ agrees to task _Support Personnel_ with diagnosing and resolving _Technical Support Requests_ related to configuring standard features of _Customer's Solution_ per the _Documentation_, use of the _CLI_ with _Customer's Solution_, downtime or software errors encountered when using _Customer's Solution_, and threats of malicious technical attack or _Data Breach_.

#### Support Request Triage

- **Critical Support Requests** are _Technical Support Requests_ that report that:

  - Systems providing _Customer's Solution_ are down or unresponsive.

  - _Users_ cannot download from or publish to _Customer's Solution_.

  - _Customer's Solution_ is under imminent threat of malicious technical attack or _Data Breach_.

- All other _Technical Support Requests_ are **Regular Support Requests**.

#### Technical Support Responsiveness

##### Support Offerings

- If _Customer's Solution_ is _npm Enterprise_, then _npm_ agrees to provide _Premium Support_. _npm_ does not offer _npm Enterprise_ with _Basic Support_.

- If _Customer's Solution_ is _npm Orgs_, then _npm_'s support commitment depends on the _Quote_. If the _Quote_ specifies _Premium Support_, then _npm_ agrees to provide _Premium Support_. Otherwise, by default, _npm_ agrees to provide _Basic Support_.

##### Premium Support

**Premium Support** means that _npm_ will:

- Respond to _Critical Support Requests_ within three _Business Hours_, and update on status every two Business Hours.

- Respond to _Regular Support Requests_ within eight _Business Hours_.

##### Basic Support

**Basic Support** means that _npm_ will:

- Respond to _Critical Support Requests_ within eight _Business Hours_, and update on status every Business Day.

- Respond to _Regular Support Requests_ within sixteen _Business Hours_.

#### Technical Support Escalation

_npm_ agrees to task _Support Personnel_ with promptly escalating _Technical Support Requests_ that _Support Personnel_ cannot resolve independently to _npm_ engineering personnel responsible for _Customer's Solution_. In general, _Support Personnel_ will remain the primary point of contact for _Customer Personnel_, coordinate with _npm_ engineering personnel, and relay questions, advice, and progress to _Customer Personnel_. Where appropriate, _Support Personnel_ may connect _Customer Personnel_ to _npm_ engineering personnel directly.

#### Refund Fees for Unresponsive Technical Support

If _npm_ fails to meet [Technical Support Responsiveness](#technical-support-responsiveness) for three _Billing Periods_ in a row, and _Customer_ ends this agreement at the end of those _Billing Periods_, citing poor support responsiveness, _npm_ agrees to refund any _Prepaid Fees_, as well as 5% of all fees that _Customer_ paid for the three _Billing Periods_.

_npm_ agrees to credit _Customer_'s account on _Notice_ and verification that _npm_ failed to provide service according to [Service-Level Agreement](#service-level-agreement) in the current _Billing Period_ or any of the three prior _Billing Periods_:

- 5% of _Service Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ between zero and one percentage point less than the _Uptime Commitment_

- 10% of _Service Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ between one and two percentage points less than the _Uptime Commitment_

- 25% of _Service Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ at or below three percentage points less than the _Uptime Commitment_

#### Apply Credits for Low Uptime

_npm_ agrees to apply any credits under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#give-credits-for-low-uptime) against _Customer_'s obligations to pay fees as soon as possible. _npm_ does not agree to refund any credits.

#### Refund Fees for Low Uptime

If _npm_ credits _Customer_'s account under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#give-credits-for-low-uptime) for three _Billing Periods_ in a row, and _Customer_ ends this agreement at the end of those _Billing Periods_, citing low _Uptime_, _npm_ agrees to refund all _Service Fees_ that _Customer_ paid for the three _Billing Periods_, as well as any _Prepaid Fees_.
