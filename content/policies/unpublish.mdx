title: npm Unpublish Policy
edit_on_github: false
---

This document describes your options when looking to unpublish a package published to the public registry.

Registry data is immutable, meaning once published, a package cannot change. We do this for reasons of security and stability of the users who depend on those packages. So if you've ever published a package called "bob" at version 1.1.0, no other package can ever be published with that name at that version. This is true even if that package is unpublished.

However, because accidents happen, we allow you to unpublish packages in the situations described below. Otherwise, you can always deprecate a package.

## Packages published less than 72 hours ago

For newly created packages, as long as no other packages in the npm Public Registry depend on your package, you can unpublish anytime within the first 72 hours after publishing.

## Packages published more than 72 hours ago

Regardless of how long ago a package was published, you can unpublish a package that:

- no other packages in the npm Public Registry depend on
- had less than 300 downloads over the last week
- has a single owner/maintainer

## How to unpublish

To unpublish a single package version, run `npm unpublish <package_name>@<version>`.

If all the versions of a package can be unpublished, you can unpublish all versions at once by running `npm unpublish <package_name> --force`.

## Considerations:

- Once `package@version` has been used, you can never use it again. You must publish a new version even if you unpublished the old one.
- Once you have unpublished a package, you will not be able to undo the unpublish.
- If you entirely unpublish all versions of a package, you may not publish any new versions of that package until 24 hours have passed.

## What to do if your package does not meet the unpublish criteria?

If your package does not meet the unpublish policy criteria, we recommend [deprecating](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/deprecate) the package. This allows the package to be downloaded but publishes a clear warning message (that you get to write) every time the package is downloaded, and on the package's npmjs.com page. Users will know that you do not recommend they use the package, but if they are depending on it their builds will not break. We consider this a good compromise between reliability and author control.

This can be achieved by using one of the following from your command line:

- `npm deprecate <package> "<message>"` to deprecate the entire package
- `npm deprecate <package>@<version> "<message>"` to deprecate a specific version

If the entire package is deprecated, the package name will be dropped from our search results.

Once deprecated, if you would also like for the package to be removed from your user profile, it can be [transferred](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/owner) to our [@npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~npm) account. This can be achieved by using the following from your command line:

- `npm owner add npm <package>`
- `npm owner rm <your_username> <package>`
