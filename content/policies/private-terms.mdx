These npm Paid Services Terms of Use (these _npm Paid Services Terms_)
supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc.
(_npm_) at <https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm Open
Source Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Paid Services_,
including but not limited to the products known as  _npm Solo_ and
_npm Orgs_, the private package storage, delivery,
organization management, and access control features of
<https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and the npm public registry
at <https://registry.npmjs.org> (the _Public Registry_). These are
collectively called the _Paid Services_.

These npm Paid Services Terms were last updated on
March 10, 2022.
You can review prior versions at
<https://github.com/npm/documentation/blob/main/content/policies/private-terms.mdx>.

You may only access or use npm Paid Services by agreeing to the npm
Open Source Terms as supplemented by these npm Paid Services Terms. If
npm adds any additional functionality to npm Paid Services, you must
agree to these npm Paid Services Terms to use those new features, too.
You add these npm Paid Services Terms to your agreement with npm by
using npm Paid Services with your account (your _Account_). These
npm Paid Services Terms then become a part of the contract between you
and npm, until you or npm disable npm Paid Services for your Account.

## Payment Terms

There is no charge for use of npm Open Source. If you use Paid Services,
these payment terms apply. When enabling Paid Services, you must provide
all the payment card details requested by the Website (your _Payment
Details_). Those details must be for a valid payment card that you have
the right to use (your _Payment Card_). You must keep your Payment
Details up-to-date via the Website.

You can disable Paid Services at any time via the Website. npm will not
refund any payment you have already made for Paid Services when you
disable Paid Services.

Dollar amounts throughout this Agreement are amounts of United States
Dollars. You must pay for Paid Services in United States Dollars.

Dollar amounts throughout this Agreement do not include tax. You will
pay any tax.

## Use of npm Paid Services

npm will provide the private package storage and delivery features and
services described in the public documentation for npm Paid Services
at <https://docs.npmjs.com/> (the _npm Paid Services
Documentation_). npm grants you permission to use those features and
services.

npm will also provide the organization management and access control
features described in the npm Paid Services Documentation, and grants
you permission to use those features and services, for npm
"organizations" to which your Account belongs.

Permission to use npm Paid Services is not exclusive to you, and you
may not transfer it to others. These npm Paid Services Terms do not
give you permission to give others rights to use npm Paid Services.
If you agree to a Payment Plan that gives you that right, you may do so
only according to that Payment Plan.

## Payment for npm Paid Services

Both your permission to use npm Paid Services and npm's commitment to
provide npm Paid Services are subject to these npm Paid Services
Terms, the npm Open Source Terms, and payment for use of npm Paid
Services by your Account under a _Payment Plan_. Payment plans include:

1. the npm Solo Payment Plan at
   <https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan>

2. or the npm Orgs Payment Plan at
   <https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/orgs-plan>

You may not use npm Paid Services unless you or someone else has
agreed to a Payment Plan, enabled npm Paid Services for your Account
under that Payment Plan, and made payment.
