This policy describes how we at npm, Inc., the company behind npmjs.com
and the npm public registry, respond to claims that materials user
have submitted to our service infringe copyright.  In short, we follow
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA.

## What's the DMCA?

The DMCA is a United States federal law that sets up a formal process
for reports of copyright infringement by our users, called takedown
notices.  It also sets up a process for disputing takedown notices
by sending counter notices.  The law protects us from liability for
infringement by our users when we follow these steps.  It also makes
those who abuse the takedown and dispute processes liable for damage
they cause.

Many online service providers like us handle great numbers of takedown
notices and counter notices.  Often, the whole process takes place
online, with the help of automated tools.  However, the legal claims
and documents involved remain very serious.  Please approach the
process accordingly.

## Should I send a takedown notice?

If you aren't absolutely sure both that you own copyright, and that a
user' material on our service infringes, speak to an attorney before
sending a DMCA takedown notice.  Knowing, material misrepresentations
about infringement in a takedown notice can make you liable to us,
the person you allege infringes, copyright owners, and licensees,
all for significant damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.
A lawyer can help you decide if you should file a takedown notice,
and if so, help you prepare it correctly.  We cannot.

## How do I send a takedown notice?

Send takedown notices to our agent.  You can find their contact
information [below](#agent).

Per United States Code, title 17, section 512(c)(3), your takedown
notice must have:

1.  A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
    on behalf of the copyright owner.

2.  Identification of the copyrighted work you claim is been infringed.

3.  Identification of the infringing material to be removed.

4.  Contact information, preferably an email address, that we can
    use to reach you.

5.  Your statement of good faith belief that use of the material in
    the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
    its agent, or the law.

6.  Your statement that the information in your notice is accurate.

7.  Your statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized
    to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright allegedly infringed.

## How do we respond to takedown notices?

When we receive a valid takedown notice, we forward a copy to the
[Lumen Database](https://lumendatabase.org/) and remove or restrict
access to allegedly infringing material.  We then try to contact
the user that submitted the material, to notify them that we have
removed or restricted access to the material, provide them a copy of
the takedown notice, and direct them to this policy.

When appropriate, we suspend or terminate the accounts of users who
repeatedly infringe copyright through our service.

## Should I dispute a takedown?

If you aren't absolutely sure that your material doesn't infringe
copyright, speak to an attorney before sending a DMCA counter notice.
Knowing, material misrepresentations about mistaken removal or access
restriction can make you liable to us, the one who filed the takedown
notice, copyright owners, and licensees, all for significant damages,
including costs and attorneys' fees.  A lawyer can help you decide
if you should file a counter notice, and if so, help you prepare
it correctly.  We cannot.

## How do I dispute a takedown?

Do _not_ resubmit material to our service that we removed or restricted
in response to a takedown notice.  If you do this, we will suspend
or terminate your account.

Send counter notices to our agent.  You can find their contact
information [below](#agent).

Per United States Code, title 17, section 512(g)(3), your counter
notice must have:

1.  Your physical or electronic signature.

2.  Identification of the material removed access-restricted, and
    where it was available via our service before we removed or
    restricted access to it.

3.  Your statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good
    faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result
    of a mistake or misidentification of the material.

4.  Your name, address, and telephone number.

5.  Your statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal
    District Court for the judicial district in which your address
    is located, or if outside the United Sates, for any any judicial
    district in which we may be found.

6.  Your statement that you will accept service of process from the
    person who provided the takedown notice, or their agent.

## How do we respond to counter notices?

When we receive a valid counter-notice, we forward a copy to the
person who filed the takedown notice.  If they don't notify us in ten
business days that they are seeking a court order to prevent further
infringement, we may replace or restore access to to the material
we removed.

## Where do I send notice?

Send all takedown notices and counter notices to:

You can also send an email notification to
[copyright@npmjs.com](mailto:copyright@npmjs.com). You may include an
attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of
your letter in the body of your message.

If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but
it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it.
Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround
than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us
your notice, our physical address is:
