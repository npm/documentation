title: Dispute Resolution
edit_on_github: false

This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve 
naming disputes with other npm publishers.  It also describes special steps
you should take about names you think [infringe your trademarks](#trademarks).

This document is additive to the guidelines in the
[npm Code of Conduct][conduct] and
[npm Open-Source terms][open-source-terms].
Nothing in this document should be interpreted to contradict any aspect
of the npm Code of Conduct or Open-Source Terms.

## tl;dr

1. Open a support ticket at <https://npmjs.com/support>
1. Explain why you require a package, org, or username transferred
1. Support will address your request. Please note submitting a report does not 
   guarantee the transfer of a package, org, or username.

## When to use this process

This process is an excellent way to:

* Request a name that you believe is currently misleading or could be confused with a name used by your company or open source project
* Request a name related to your company or open source project that cannot be claimed via account recovery

This process does not apply if the package violates our
[Terms of Use][open-source-terms],
in particular our
[Acceptable Use][acceptable-use]
and [Acceptable Content][acceptable-content]
rules, or our [Code of Conduct][conduct].
Those documents refer to this one to resolve cases of "squatting"; see
below.

If you see bad behavior or content you believe is unacceptable, refer to
the Code of Conduct for guidelines on
[reporting violations][violations].
**You are never expected to resolve abusive behavior on your own.**
**We are here to help.**

## When not to use this process

This process is not available for dispute requests due to lack of activity
related to a specific name.

Please also note there are cases where a party may have claim to a specific name,
but giving that name to the requesting party would pose a supply-chain risk
to the npm ecosystem. In such cases, requests may be denied independent of
the validity of the claim.

## Beginning the process

### Packages

To dispute a package called `foo`, follow these steps:

1. Open a support ticket at <https://npmjs.com/support>, indicating that
   you would like to start the process to request ownership of the `foo`
   package. Please explain the why you believe the package should be transferred.
   You will get an automated reply from npm support to your email address.
1. Support will address your request. Please note submitting a report does not 
   guarantee the transfer of a package.

### Organizations

To dispute an organization name, follow these steps:

1. Open a support ticket at <https://npmjs.com/support>, indicating that
   you dispute an organization name.  Include the name of the organization,
   e.g. `@foo`.  Please explain the why you believe the Organizations should
   be transferred. You will get an automated reply from npm support to your
   email address.
1. Support will address your request. Please note submitting a report does not 
   guarantee the transfer of an organization.

### User names

To dispute a user name, follow these steps:

1. Open a support ticket at <https://npmjs.com/support>, indicating that
   you dispute a user name.  Include the name of the user account,
   e.g. `@foo`. Please explain why you believe the Username should be 
   transferred. You will get an automated reply from npm support to your
   email address.
1. Support will address your request. Please note submitting a report does not 
   guarantee the transfer of a user name.

## Trademarks

If you think another npm publisher is infringing your trademark, such
as by using a confusingly similar package, org, or user account name,
open a support ticket at <https://npmjs.com/support> with a link to
the package, org, or user account page on <https://npmjs.com>. Attach
a copy of your trademark registration certificate.

If we see that the user, org, or package publisher is intentionally
misleading others by misusing your registered mark without permission,
we will transfer the account, org, or package name to you.  Otherwise, we
will contact the relevant user and ask them to clear up any confusion with
changes to their user account page, or page, or package `README` file.

Use of npm's own trademarks is covered by our Trademark Policy at
<https://docs.npmjs.com/trademark>.

## Definitions

### Squatting

It is against npm's
[Terms of Use][acceptable-content]
to publish a package, register a user name or an organization name
simply for the purposes of reserving it for future use.

We do not pro-actively scan the registry for squatted packages, so
the fact that a name is in use does not mean we consider it valid.
The standards for what we consider squatting depend on what is being
squatted:

#### Packages

Package names are considered squatted if the package has no genuine
function.

#### Organizations

Organization names are considered squatted if there are no packages
published within a reasonable time. If an organization is a paid
organization, it may have private packages that are invisible to
third parties. For privacy reasons, we cannot reveal whether or not
an organization has private packages, so a paid organization will
never be considered squatted.

#### User names

We are extremely unlikely to transfer control of a user name, as it
is totally valid to be an npm user and never publish any packages:
for instance, you might be part of an organization or need read-only
access to private packages.
