title: Dispute Resolution
edit_on_github: false
---

This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve 
naming disputes with other npm publishers.  It also describes the steps
you should take if you think a name [infringes your trademark](#trademarks).

This document is additive to the guidelines in the
[npm Code of Conduct][conduct] and
[npm Open-Source terms][open-source-terms].
Nothing in this document should be interpreted to contradict any aspect
of the npm Code of Conduct or Open-Source Terms.

## tl;dr

1. Open a support ticket at <https://support.github.com/contact/npm-name-disputes>.
1. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible.
1. Support will address your request. Please note submitting a report does not 
   guarantee the transfer of a package, org, or username.

## When to use this process

This process is an excellent way to:

* Request a name that you believe is currently misleading or could be confused with a name used by your company or open source project
* Request a name related to your company or open source project that cannot be claimed via account recovery

This process does not apply if the package violates our
[Terms of Use][open-source-terms],
in particular our
[Acceptable Use][acceptable-use]
and [Acceptable Content][acceptable-content]
rules, or our [Code of Conduct][conduct].
Those documents refer to this one to resolve cases of "squatting"; see
below.

If you see bad behavior or content you believe is unacceptable, refer to
the Code of Conduct for guidelines on
[reporting violations][violations].
**You are never expected to resolve abusive behavior on your own.**
**We are here to help.**

## When not to use this process

This process is not available for dispute requests due to lack of activity
related to a specific name.

Please also note there are cases where a party may have claim to a specific name,
but giving that name to the requesting party would pose a supply-chain risk
to the npm ecosystem. In such cases, requests may be denied independent of
the validity of the claim.

## Trademarks

npm processes Trademark claims under GitHub's [Trademark Policy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy).

If you think another npm publisher is infringing your trademark, such
as by using a confusingly similar package, org, or user account name, please submit a Trademark Policy Violation Report via our [form](https://support.github.com/contact/trademark-policy).

Use of npm's own trademarks is covered by our [Logo and Usage Policy][logos-and-usage].

## Changes

This is a living document and may be updated from time to time.
Please refer to the [git history for this

## Definitions

### Squatting

It is against npm's
[Terms of Use][acceptable-content]
to publish a package, register a user name or an organization name
simply for the purposes of reserving it for future use.

We do not pro-actively scan the registry for squatted packages, so
the fact that a name is in use does not mean we consider it valid.
The standards for what we consider squatting depend on what is being
squatted:

#### Packages

Package names are considered squatted if the package has no genuine
function.

#### Organizations

Organization names are considered squatted if there are no packages
published within a reasonable time. If an organization is a paid
organization, it may have private packages that are invisible to
third parties. For privacy reasons, we cannot reveal whether or not
an organization has private packages, so a paid organization will
never be considered squatted.

#### User names

We are extremely unlikely to transfer control of a user name, as it
is totally valid to be an npm user and never publish any packages:
for instance, you might be part of an organization or need read-only
access to private packages.
