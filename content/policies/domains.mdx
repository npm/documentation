title: What domains does npm use?
---

How can you tell an email or domain really belongs to npm and isn't a phishing attempt? Here's a full list:

## Active domains

* registry.npmjs.org - the official, default npm registry
* npmjs.com - the domain of our website and any email from us
* npm.im - a short domain used to redirect to packages, e.g. npm.im/express
* npm.me - a short domain used for redirects in marketing campaigns, ads, etc.
* npm.red - a domain used for staging our website and registry in development

## Formerly used

* npmcamp.com, npm.camp - for our conference

## Idle

We own these but don't use them for anything (yet).

* npmjs.net
* npm.rocks
* npm.tips
* npm.xyz
* npm.computer
* npm.technology
* npm.today
* npm.email
* npm.mn
* npm.so
