As an organization owner, you can remove members from your organization if they are no longer collaborating on packages owned or governed by your organization.

If you remove a member from an npm Teams subscription (a paid organization), then they will lose access to your organization's private packages, and the credit card on file for your organization will not be charged for them on the next billing cycle.

<Note>

**Note:** Members are not notified when you remove them from your organization.
