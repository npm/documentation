## Accepting an organization invitation

If you receive an invitation to an organization, you have to accept the invitation over email to be added to the organization.

You have the option to use a different email address than the one that received the invitation to join the organization.

1. Click the verification link in the organization invitation email.

2. You will be prompted to log into your npm user account. If you don't have an npm user account, you can sign up for one.

## Rejecting an organization invitation

If you are invited to an organization that you do not want to join, you can let the invitation expire. Organization invitations expire after one week.
