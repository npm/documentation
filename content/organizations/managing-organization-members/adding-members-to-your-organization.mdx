As an organization owner, you can add other npm users to your organization to give them read or read and write access to public and private packages within your organization's scope, as well as public unscoped packages governed by your organization.

When you add a member to your organization, they are sent an email inviting them to the organization.

Once the new member [accepts the invitation][accept-invitation], they are:

- assigned the role of "[member][member-perms]"
- added to the ["developers" team][developers-team]

If you have a [paid organization][paid-org], as part of an npm Teams plan, you will be billed $7 per month for each new member.
