An organization administrator can delete the organization; packages in the organization will also [be deleted](/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry) if they fulfill the [requirements to unpublish packages](/policies/unpublish). Packages that cannot be deleted can be [deprecated](/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions) instead.
