If you have an npm user account, you can convert your user account to an organization. When you convert your user account to an organization, we will:

- Create a new organization with the name of your user account.
- Prompt you to create a new npm user account. We recommend choosing a variation of your old user name so collaborators will recognize you. For example, if your old username was "wombat", your new username might be "wombat-new".
- Make your new npm user account an owner of your new organization.
- Add your new npm user account to a team called "Developers" in your new organization.
- Transfer packages owned by your user account to your new organization.
- Transfer your existing organization and team memberships and contributor access settings to your new user account.

**Note:** Once your old user account has been converted to an organization, you will no longer be able to sign in to npm with your old user account.
