As an organization member, you can configure your npm client to:

- make a single package or all new packages you create locally use your organization's scope
- make a single package or all new packages you create locally have default public visibility

Before configuring your npm client, you must [install npm][install-npm].

## Configuring your npm client to use your organization's scope

If you will be publishing packages with your organization's scope often, you can add your organization's scope to your global `.npmrc` configuration file.

### Setting your organization scope for all new packages

<Note>

**Note:** Setting the organization scope using the steps below will only set the scope for new packages; for existing packages, you will need to update the `name` field in `package.json`.

</Note>

On the command line, run the following command, replacing &lt;org-name&gt; with the name of your organization:

```
npm config set scope <org-name> --global
```

For packages you do not want to publish with your organization's scope, you must manually edit the package's `package.json` to remove the organization scope from the `name` field.

### Setting your organization scope for a single package

1. On the command line, navigate to the package directory.

   ```
   cd /path/to/package
   ```

2. Run the following command, replacing &lt;org-name&gt; with the name of your organization:

    ```
    npm config set scope <org-name>
    ```

## Changing default package visibility to public

By default, publishing a scoped package with `npm publish` will publish the package as private. If you are a member of an organization on the free organization plan, or are on the paid organization plan but want to publish a scoped package as public, you must pass the `--access public` flag:

```
npm publish --access public
```

### Setting package visibility to public for a single package

You can set a single package to pass `--access public ` to every `npm publish` command that you issue for that package.

1. On the command line, navigate to the package directory.

   ```
   cd /path/to/package

2. Run the following command:

    ```
    npm config set access public
    ```

### Setting package visibility to public for all packages

You can set all packages to pass `--access public ` to every `npm publish` command that you issue for that package.

<Note>

**Warning:** Setting packages access to `public` in your global `.npmrc` will affect all packages you create, including packages in your personal account scope, as well as packages scoped to your organization.

</Note>

On the command line, run the following command:

```
npm config set access public --global
```
