Every organization is granted an organization scope, a unique namespace for packages owned by the organization that matches the organization name. For example, an organization named "wombat" would have the scope `@wombat`.

You can use scopes to:

- Maintain a fork of a package: `@wombat/request`.
- Avoid name disputes with popular names: `@wombat/web`.
- Easily find packages in the same namespace

Packages in a scope must follow the same [naming guidelines][name-guidelines] as unscoped packages.

## Managing unscoped packages

While you are granted a scope by default when you create an organization, you can also use organizations to manage unscoped packages, or packages under a different scope (such as a user scope).
