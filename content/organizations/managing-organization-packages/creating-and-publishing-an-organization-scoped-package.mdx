As an organization member, you can create and publish public and private packages within the organization's scope.

## Creating an organization scoped package

1. On the command line, make a directory with the name of the package you would like to create.

   ```
   mkdir /path/to/package/directory
   ```

2. Navigate to the newly-created package directory.

3. To create an organization scoped package, on the command line, run:

   ```
   npm init --scope=<your_org_name>
   ```

4. To verify the package is using your organization scope, in a text editor, open the package's `package.json` file and check that the name is `@your_org_name/<pkg_name>`, replacing `your_org_name` with the name of your organization.

## Publishing a private organization scoped package

By default, `npm publish` will publish a scoped package as private.

By default, any scoped package is published as private. However, if you have an organization that does not have the Private Packages feature, `npm publish` will fail unless you pass the `access` flag.

1. On the command line, navigate to the package directory.

2. Run `npm publish`.

Private packages will say `private` below the package name on the npm website.

## Publishing a public organization scoped package

To publish an organization scoped package as public, use `npm publish --access public`.

1. On the command line, navigate to the package directory.

2. Run `npm publish --access public`.

Public packages will say `public` below the package name on the npm website.
