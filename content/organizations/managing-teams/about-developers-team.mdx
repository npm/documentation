title: About the Developers team
---

The Developers team is automatically created when you create an organization. By default, the Developers team has read/write access to all new packages created under the organization's scope.

- Members added to the organization, including the organization owner, are automatically added to the Developers team
- The [`maintainers` field] in the [`package.json`] of any newly created packages under the organization scope
is automatically populated with the members of the current Developers team

If you create a new package under your organization's scope and you do not
want members of the Developers team to have read/write access to that
package, an owner or admin can remove the Developers team's access to that
package. For more informations, see "[Managing team access to organization packages][pkg-access]".

If an owner adds a new member to an organization and **does not** want
that member to be on the Developers team, an owner can remove them.

<Note>

**Note:** The Developers team can no longer be removed from an organization for the following reasons:

* It is the source of truth for all users, packages, and default permissions in an organization.
* When you want to restrict write access, it is almost always better to set the default permissions to read-only and create separate teams for managing write permissions.
